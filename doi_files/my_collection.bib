abstract = {Human Immunodeficiency Virus type-1 (HIV-1) acquires its lipid membrane from the plasma membrane of the infected cell from where it buds out. Previous studies have shown that the HIV-1 envelope is a very low mobility environment with the diffusion of incorporated proteins two orders of magnitude slower than in plasma membrane. One of the reasons for this difference is thought to be due to HIV-1 membrane composition that is characterised by a high degree of rigidity and lipid packing. To further refine the model of the molecular mobility on HIV-1 surface, we here investigated the relative importance of membrane composition and curvature in Large Unilamellar Vesicles of different composition and size (0.2-1 $\mu$m) by super-resolution STED microscopy-based fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (STED-FCS) analysis. We find that lipid composition and its rigidity but not membrane curvature play an important role in the decreased molecular mobility on vesicle surface thus confirming that this factor is an essential determinant of HIV-1 low surface mobility. Our results provide further insight into the dynamic properties of the surface of individual HIV-1 particles.},

abstract = {The performance of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations is limited by an integration timestep of 2 femtoseconds (fs), which is needed to resolve the fastest degrees of freedom in the system, namely, the vibration of bonds and angles involving hydrogen atoms. The Virtual Interaction Sites (VIS) method replaces hydrogen atoms by mass- less virtual interaction sites to eliminate these degrees of freedom while keeping intact non-bonded interactions and the explicit treatment of hydrogen atoms. We have modified the existing VIS algorithm for most lipids in the popular CHARMM36 force field by increasing the hydrogen atom masses at regular intervals in the lipid acyl chains, and obtained lipid properties and pore formation free energies in very good agreement with those calculated in simulations without VIS. Our modified VIS scheme enables a 5 fs timestep resulting in a significant performance gain for all atom simulations of membranes. The method has the potential to make longer time and length scales accessible in all-atom simulations of membrane-protein complexes.},

abstract = {Many proteins that perform important biological functions are completely or partially disordered under physiological conditions. Molecular dynamics simulations could be a powerful tool for the structural characterization of such proteins, but it has been unclear whether the physical models (force fields) used in simulations are sufficiently accurate. Here, we systematically compare the accuracy of a number of different force fields in simulations of both ordered and disordered proteins, finding that each force field has strengths and limitations. We then describe a force field that substantially improves on the state-of-the-art accuracy for simulations of disordered proteins without sacrificing accuracy for folded proteins, thus broadening the range of biological systems amenable to molecular dynamics simulations.Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is a valuable tool for characterizing the structural dynamics of folded proteins and should be similarly applicable to disordered proteins and proteins with both folded and disordered regions. It has been unclear, however, whether any physical model (force field) used in MD simulations accurately describes both folded and disordered proteins. Here, we select a benchmark set of 21 systems, including folded and disordered proteins, simulate these systems with six state-of-the-art force fields, and compare the results to over 9,000 available experimental data points. We find that none of the tested force fields simultaneously provided accurate descriptions of folded proteins, of the dimensions of disordered proteins, and of the secondary structure propensities of disordered proteins. Guided by simulation results on a subset of our benchmark, however, we modified parameters of one force field, achieving excellent agreement with experiment for disordered proteins, while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy for folded proteins. The resulting force field, a99SB-disp, should thus greatly expand the range of biological systems amenable to MD simulation. A similar approach could be taken to improve other force fields.},

abstract = {Cell membrane deformations are crucial for proper cell function. Specialized protein assemblies initiate inward or outward membrane deformations that turn into, for example, filopodia or endocytic intermediates. Actin dynamics and actin-binding proteins are involved in this process, although their detailed role remains controversial. We show here that a dynamic, branched actin network is sufficient, in absence of any membrane-associated proteins, to initiate both inward and outward membrane deformation. With actin polymerization triggered at the membrane of liposomes, we produce inward filopodia-like structures at low tension, while outward endocytosis-like structures are robustly generated regardless of tension. Our results are reminiscent of endocytosis in mammalian cells, where actin polymerization forces are required when membrane tension is increased, and in yeast, where they are always required to overcome the opposing turgor pressure. By combining experimental observations with physical modeling, we propose a mechanism for actin-driven endocytosis under high tension or high pressure conditions.},

abstract = {P4-ATPases are phospholipid flippases that translocate phospholipids from the exoplasmic/luminal to the cytoplasmic leaflet of biological membranes. All P4-ATPases in yeast and some in other organisms are required for membrane trafficking; therefore, changes in the transbilayer lipid composition induced by flippases are thought to be crucial for membrane deformation. However, it is poorly understood whether the phospholipid-flipping activity of P4-ATPases can promote membrane deformation. In this study, we assessed membrane deformation induced by flippase activity via monitoring the extent of membrane tubulation using a system that allows inducible recruitment of Bin/amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domains to the plasma membrane (PM). Enhanced phosphatidylcholine-flippase activity at the PM due to expression of ATP10A, a member of the P4-ATPase family, promoted membrane tubulation upon recruitment of BAR domains to the PM. This is the important evidence that changes in the transbilayer lipid composition induced by P4-ATPases can deform biological membranes.The EMBO Journal (2018) 37: e97705},

Here, we report the results of atomic-level simulations in which we observed five protein-protein pairs repeatedly associate to, and dissociate from, their experimentally determined native complexes using a new molecular dynamics (MD)-based sampling approach that does not make use of any prior structural information about the complexes. To study association mechanisms, we performed additional, conventional MD simulations, in which we observed numerous spontaneous association events. A shared feature of native association for these five structurally and functionally diverse protein systems was that if the proteins made contact far from the native interface, the native state was reached by dissociation and eventual re-association near the native interface, rather than by extensive interfacial exploration while the proteins remained in contact. At the transition state (the conformational ensemble from which association to the native complex and dissociation are equally likely), the protein-protein interfaces were still highly hydrated, and no more than 20{\%} of native contacts had formed.},

abstract = {While Langevin integrators are popular in the study of equilibrium properties of complex systems, it is challenging to estimate the timestep-induced discretization error: the degree to which the sampled phase-space or configuration-space probability density departs from the desired target density due to the use of a finite integration timestep. In [Sivak et al. PRX 3: 011007, 2013], Sivak et al. introduced a convenient approach to approximating a natural measure of error between the sampled density and the target equilibrium density, the KL divergence, in phase space, but did not specifically address the issue of configuration-space properties, which are much more commonly of interest in molecular simulations. Here, we introduce a variant of this near-equilibrium estimator capable of measuring the error in the configuration-space marginal density, validating it against a complex but exact nested Monte Carlo estimator to show that it reproduces the KL divergence with high fidelity. To illustrate its utility, we employ this new near-equilibrium estimator to assess a claim that a recently proposed Langevin integrator introduces extremely small configuration-space density errors up to the stability limit at no extra computational expense. Finally, we show how this approach to quantifying sampling bias can be applied to a wide variety of stochastic integrators by following a straightforward procedure to compute the appropriate shadow work, and describe how it can be extended to quantify the error in arbitrary marginal or conditional distributions of interest.},

@article{Mobley286542,
abstract = {Here, we focus on testing and improving force fields for molecular modeling, which see widespread use in diverse areas of computational chemistry and biomolecular simulation. A key issue affecting the accuracy and transferrability of these force fields is the use of atom typing. Traditional approaches to defining molecular mechanics force fields must encode, within a discrete set of atom types, all information which will ever be needed about the chemical environment; parameters are then assigned by looking up combinations of these atom types in tables. This atom typing approach leads to a wide variety of problems such as inextensible atom-typing machinery, enormous difficulty in expanding parameters encoded by atom types, and unnecessarily proliferation of encoded parameters. Here, we describe a new approach to assigning parameters for molecular mechanics force fields based on the industry standard SMARTS chemical perception language (with extensions to identify specific atoms available in SMIRKS). In this approach, each force field term (bonds, angles, and torsions, and nonbonded interactions) features separate definitions assigned in a hierarchical manner without using atom types. We accomplish this using direct chemical perception, where parameters are assigned directly based on substructure queries operating on the molecule(s) being parameterized, thereby avoiding the intermediate step of assigning atom types --- a step which can be considered indirect chemical perception. Direct chemical perception allows for substantial simplification of force fields, as well as additional generality in the substructure queries. This approach is applicable to a wide variety of (bio)molecular systems, and can greatly reduce the number of parameters needed to create a complete force field. Further flexibility can also be gained by allowing force field terms to be interpolated based on the assignment of fractional bond orders via the same procedure used to assign partial charges. As an example of the utility of this approach, we provide a minimalist small molecule force field derived from Merck{\{}$\backslash$textquoteright{\}}s parm@Frosst (an Amber parm99 descendant), in which a parameter definition file only approximately 300 lines long can parameterize a large and diverse spectrum of pharmaceutically relevant small molecule chemical space. We benchmark this minimalist force field on the FreeSolv small molecule hydration free energy set and calculations of densities and dielectric constants from the ThermoML Archive, demonstrating that it achieves comparable accuracy to the Generalized Amber Force Field (GAFF) that consists of many thousands of parameters.},

The manual extraction of valuable information from such reaction paths is straightforward but unfeasible for large and complex reaction networks.

The insertion free energies were calculated using two different protein and lipid force fields (OPLS protein/united-atom lipids and CHARMM36 protein/all-atom lipids) and found to be independent of the simulation parameters. In addition, the free energy of insertion is found to be independent of temperature for both force fields. However, we find major difference in the partitioning kinetics between OPLS and CHARMM36, likely due to the difference in roughness of the underlying free energy surfaces. Our results demonstrate not only a reliable method to calculate insertion free energies for peptides, but also represent a rare case where equilibrium simulations and PMF calculations can be directly compared.},

abstract = {Lipid droplets (LDs) store fats and play critical roles in lipid and energy homeostasis. They form between the leaflets of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and consist of a neutral lipid core wrapped in a phospholipid monolayer with proteins. Two types of ER-LD architecture are thought to exist and be essential for LD functioning. Maturing LDs either emerge from the ER into the cytoplasm, remaining attached to the ER by a narrow membrane neck, or stay embedded in the ER and are surrounded by ER membrane. Here, we identify a lipid-based mechanism that controls which of these two architectures is favored. Theoretical modeling indicated that the intrinsic molecular curvatures of ER phospholipids can determine whether LDs remain embedded in or emerge from the ER; lipids with negative intrinsic curvature such as diacylglycerol (DAG) and phosphatidylethanolamine favor LD embedding, while those with positive intrinsic curvature, like lysolipids, support LD emergence. This prediction was verified by altering the lipid composition of the ER in S. cerevisiae using mutants and the addition of exogenous lipids. We found that fat-storage-inducing transmembrane protein 2 (FIT2) homologs become enriched at sites of LD generation when biogenesis is induced. DAG accumulates at sites of LD biogenesis, and FIT2 proteins may promote LD emergence from the ER by reducing DAG levels at these sites. Altogether, our findings suggest that cells regulate LD integration in the ER by modulating ER lipid composition, particularly at sites of LD biogenesis and that FIT2 proteins may play a central role in this process.},

We summarize existing strategies for obtaining membrane elastic moduli and clarify the differences in the underlying approaches. We analyze these strategies in depth, including several important advantages and limitations. By addressing these limitations, we obtain a newly formulated spatially local methodology for extracting bending and tilt moduli: The Real Space Instantaneous Surface Method (ReSIS). With its freely available implementation, this method is designed for highly dynamic systems with arbitrary interface geometries. We demonstrate how the method provides consistent results for membranes of arbitrary size. In addition, we describe alternative implementations of various Fourier-space methods, and use these to compare the results from the different available methods and from published computational data. We specifically focus on the tilt modulus, where very large differences between Fourier and real-space based methods are observed, including those derived using ReSIS. These discrepancies are likely due to the known difference between model moduli and thermodynamic moduli that are derived from the corresponding response functions. In addition, we reexamine the issue of angular degeneracy and its effect on conformational ensembles. Finally, a van 't Hoff analysis of the tilt and bending moduli reveals that both modes act as entropic springs and that enthalpy favors nonzero tilt, perhaps heralding the spontaneous lipid chain tilt of the gel phase at lower temperatures.},

abstract = {Cellular membranes are remodeled continuously to facilitate membrane traffic, organelle biogenesis, and cell division. The crescent-shaped bin-amphiphysin-rvs (BAR) domains are a key class of membrane remodeling proteins, which polymerize into ordered cylindrical scaffolds that transform membranes into tubules. Isolated BAR domains stabilize these tubules against membrane fission, the division of membrane surfaces into separate compartments. But in nature BAR domains are rarely isolated. Instead they are part of multi-domain proteins that frequently contain intrinsically-disordered regions of substantial molecular weight. How might these bulky disordered regions alter the membrane shaping functions of BAR domains? Here we show that full-length amphiphysin and FCHo1 proteins, which respectively contain highly-curved N-BAR and modestly-curved F-BAR domains coupled to large disordered regions, are surprisingly potent drivers of membrane fission. Specifically, we use multiple, independent assays to demonstrate that when these BAR scaffolds assemble at membrane surfaces, their bulky disordered domains become highly concentrated, generating substantial steric pressure that destabilizes tubules, promoting fission. These findings illustrate a mechanism that overcomes the energetic barrier to membrane fission by coupling structure-driven membrane scaffolding to entropically-driven protein crowding. Interestingly, this behavior applies to BAR domains with a range of curvatures, suggesting that the ability of BAR scaffolds to concentrate disordered domains, rather than their inherent structural curvature, is the key requirement for fission. More broadly, this work challenges the paradigm that BAR domain-containing proteins stabilize membrane tubules, suggesting instead that they are key components of the membrane fission machinery.},

While salt bridges are known to be important both for protein stability, recognition and regulation, we still do not have fully accurate predictive models to assess the energetic contributions of salt bridges. Molecular dynamics simulations is one technique that may be used study the complex relationship between structure, solvation and energetics of salt bridges, but the accuracy of such simulations depend on the force field used. We have used NMR data on the B1 domain of protein G (GB1) to benchmark molecular dynamics simulations. Using enhanced sampling simulations, we calculated the free energy of forming a salt bridge for three possible ionic interactions in GB1. The NMR experiments showed that these interactions are either not formed, or only very weakly formed, in solution. In contrast, we show that the stability of the salt bridges is slightly overestimated in simulations of GB1 using six commonly used combinations of force fields and water models. We therefore conclude that further work is needed to refine our ability to model quantitatively the stability of salt bridges through simulations, and that comparisons between experiments and simulations will play a crucial role in furthering our understanding of this important interaction.},

To date, no functional expression of a reaction coordinate capable of biasing molecular dynamics simulations to produce membrane curvature has been reported. This represents a major drawback given that the adequate identification of proper collective variables to enhance sampling is fundamental for restrained dynamics techniques. In this work, we present a closed-form equation of a collective variable that induces bending in lipid bilayers in a controlled manner, allowing for straightforward calculation of free energy landscapes of important curvature-related events, using standard methods such as umbrella sampling and metadynamics. As a direct application of the collective variable, we calculate the bending free energies of a ternary lipid bilayer in the presence and the absence of a Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs domain with an N-terminal amphipathic helix (N-BAR), a well-known peripheral membrane protein that induces curvature.},

abstract = {We recently developed a new coarse-grained model of protein structure and dynamics [Dawid et al. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2017, 13(11), 5766−5779]. The model assumed a single bead representation of amino acid residues, where positions of such united residues were defined by centers of mass of four amino acid fragments. Replica exchange Monte Carlo sampling of the model chains provided good pictures of modeled structures and their dynamics. In its generic form the statistical knowledge-based force field of the model has been dedicated for single-domain globular proteins. Sequence-specific interactions are defined by three-letter secondary structure data. In the present work we demonstrate that different assignments and/or predictions of secondary structures are usually sufficient for enforcing cooperative formation of native-like folds of SURPASS chains for the majority of single-domain globular proteins. Simulations of native-like structure assembly for a representative set of globular proteins have shown that the accuracy of secondary structure data is usually not crucial for model performance, although some specific errors can strongly distort the obtained three-dimensional structures.},

abstract = {Lipid droplets are conserved specialized organelles that store neutral lipids. Our view on this unique organelle has evolved from a simple fat deposit to a highly dynamic and functionally diverse hub—one that mediates the buffering of fatty acid stress and the adaptive reshaping of lipid metabolism to promote membrane and organelle homeostasis and the integrity of central proteostasis pathways, including autophagy, which ensure stress resistance and cell survival. This Review will summarize the recent developments in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as this model organism has been instrumental in deciphering the fundamental mechanisms and principles of lipid droplet biology and interconnecting lipid droplets with many unanticipated cellular functions applicable to many other cell systems.This article is protected by copyright.

abstract = {Cells store excess energy in the form of neutral lipids that are synthesized and encapsulated within the endoplasmic reticulum intermonolayer space. The lipids next demix to form lipid droplets (LDs), which, surprisingly, bud off mostly toward the cytosol. This directional LD formation is critical to energy metabolism, but its mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we reconstituted the LD formation topology by embedding artificial LDs into the intermonolayer space of bilayer vesicles. We provide experimental evidence that the droplet behavior in the membrane is recapitulated by the physics of three-phase wetting systems, dictated by the equilibrium of surface tensions. We thereupon determined that slight tension asymmetries between the membrane monolayers regulate the droplet budding side. A differential regulation of lipid or protein composition around a forming LD can generate a monolayer tension asymmetry that will determine the LD budding side. Our results offer, to our knowledge, new insights on how the proteins might regulate LD formation side by generating a monolayer tension asymmetry.},

abstract = {Cells in our bodies sense and communicate with the outside world via proteins embedded in membranes that surround the cells. As with all proteins, a fundamental parameter governing their biological function is the inherent, thermodynamic stability of the folded state. Surprisingly, there is no measure of this thermodynamic stability in a lipid membrane for the ubiquitous class of membrane proteins with structures based on $\alpha$-helices. We remedy this through the study of a protein related to the physiologically important membrane proteins that are partly responsible for transmitting signals in the nervous system. We identify key properties of the surrounding lipid membrane that regulate the thermodynamic stability of the protein.$\alpha$-Helical membrane proteins have eluded investigation of their thermodynamic stability in lipid bilayers. Reversible denaturation curves have enabled some headway in determining unfolding free energies. However, these parameters have been limited to detergent micelles or lipid bicelles, which do not possess the same mechanical properties as lipid bilayers that comprise the basis of natural membranes. We establish reversible unfolding of the membrane transporter LeuT in lipid bilayers, enabling the comparison of apparent unfolding free energies in different lipid compositions. LeuT is a bacterial ortholog of neurotransmitter transporters and contains a knot within its 12-transmembrane helical structure. Urea is used as a denaturant for LeuT in proteoliposomes, resulting in the loss of up to 30{\%} helical structure depending upon the lipid bilayer composition. Urea unfolding of LeuT in liposomes is reversible, with refolding in the bilayer recovering the original helical structure and transport activity. A linear dependence of the unfolding free energy on urea concentration enables the free energy to be extrapolated to zero denaturant. Increasing lipid headgroup charge or chain lateral pressure increases the thermodynamic stability of LeuT. The mechanical and charge properties of the bilayer also affect the ability of urea to denature the protein. Thus, we not only gain insight to the long{\{}$\backslash$textendash{\}}sought-after thermodynamic stability of an $\alpha$-helical protein in a lipid bilayer but also provide a basis for studies of the folding of knotted proteins in a membrane environment.},
