"Simulation of Reversible Protein−Protein Binding and Calculation of Binding Free Energies Using Perturbed Distance Restraints

DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00706

Virtually all biological processes depend on the interaction between proteins at some point. The correct prediction of biomolecular binding free-energies has many interesting applications in both basic and applied pharmaceutical research. While recent advances in the field of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have proven the feasibility of the calculation of protein−protein binding free energies, the large conformational freedom of proteins and complex free energy landscapes of binding processes make such calculations a difficult task. Moreover, convergence and reversibility of resulting free-energy values remain poorly described. In this work, an easyto-use, yet robust approach for the calculation of standard-state protein− protein binding free energies using perturbed distance restraints is described. In the binding process the conformations of the proteins were restrained, as suggested earlier. Two approaches to avoid end-state problems upon release of the conformational restraints were compared. The method was evaluated by practical application to a small model complex of ubiquitin and the very flexible ubiquitin-binding domain of human DNA polymerase ι (UBM2). All computed free energy differences were closely monitored for convergence, and the calculated binding free energies had a mean unsigned deviation of only 1.4 or 2.5 kJ·mol−1 from experimental values. Statistical error estimates were in the order of thermal noise. We conclude that the presented method has promising potential for broad applicability to quantitatively describe protein−protein and various other kinds of complex formation.","Han, H., N. Monroe, W.I. Sundquist, P.S. Shen, and C.P. Hill. 2017. The AAA ATPase Vps4 binds ESCRT-III substrates through a repeating array of dipeptide-binding pockets. eLife. 6: 1–15.

The hexameric AAA ATPase Vps4 drives membrane fission by remodeling and disassembling ESCRT-III filaments. Building upon our earlier 4.3 Å resolution cryo-EM structure (Monroe et al., 2017), we now report a 3.2 Å structure of Vps4 bound to an ESCRT-III peptide substrate. The new structure reveals that the peptide approximates a β-strand conformation whose helical symmetry matches that of the five Vps4 subunits it contacts directly. Adjacent Vps4 subunits make equivalent interactions with successive substrate dipeptides through two distinct classes of side chain binding pockets formed primarily by Vps4 pore loop 1. These pockets accommodate a wide range of residues, while main chain hydrogen bonds may help dictate substrate-binding orientation. The structure supports a ‘conveyor belt’ model of translocation in which ATP binding allows a Vps4 subunit to join the growing end of the helix and engage the substrate, while hydrolysis and release promotes helix disassembly and substrate release at the lagging end.","A Method for Quantifying Molecular Interactions Using Stochastic Modelling and SuperResolution Microscopy

We introduce the Interaction Factor (IF), a measure for quantifying the interaction of molecular clusters in super-resolution microscopy images. The IF is robust in the sense that it is independent of cluster density, and it only depends on the extent of the pair-wise interaction between different types of molecular clusters in the image. The IF for a single or a collection of images is estimated by first using stochastic modelling where the locations of clusters in the images are repeatedly randomized to estimate the distribution of the overlaps between the clusters in the absence of interaction (IF = 0). Second, an analytical form of the relationship between IF and the overlap (which has the random overlap as its only parameter) is used to estimate the IF for the experimentally observed overlap. The advantage of IF compared to conventional methods to quantify interaction in microscopy images is that it is insensitive to changing cluster density and is an absolute measure of interaction, making the interpretation of experiments easier. We validate the IF method by using both simulated and experimental data and provide an ImageJ plugin for determining the IF of an image.

The adsorption of ions to aqueous interfaces is a phenomenon that profoundly influences vital processes in many areas of science, including biology, atmospheric chemistry, electrical energy storage, and water process engineering. Although classical electrostatics theory predicts that ions are repelled from water/hydrophobe (e.g., air/water) interfaces, both computer simulations and experiments have shown that chaotropic ions actually exhibit enhanced concentrations at the air/water interface. Although mechanistic pictures have been developed to explain this counterintuitive observation, their general applicability, particularly in the presence of material substrates, remains unclear. Here we investigate ion adsorption to the model interface formed by water and graphene. Deep UV second harmonic generation measurements of the SCN− ion, a prototypical chaotrope, determined a free energy of adsorption within error of that for air/water. Unlike for the air/water interface, wherein repartitioning of the solvent energy drives ion adsorption, our computer simulations reveal that direct ion/graphene interactions dominate the favorable enthalpy change. Moreover, the graphene sheets dampen capillary waves such that rotational anisotropy of the solute, if present, is the dominant entropy contribution, in contrast to the air/water interface.

Cell membranes are crowded and complex environments. To investigate the effect of protein-lipid interactions on dynamic organization in mammalian cell membranes, we have performed coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations containing >100 copies of an inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channel which forms specific interactions with the regulatory lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). The tendency of protein molecules to cluster has the effect of organizing the membrane into dynamic compartments. At the same time, the diversity of lipids present has a marked effect on the clustering behavior of ion channels. Sub-diffusion of proteins and lipids is observed. Protein crowding alters the sub-diffusive behavior of proteins and lipids such as PIP2 which interact tightly with Kir channels. Protein crowding also affects bilayer properties, such as membrane undulations and bending rigidity, in a PIP2-dependent manner. This interplay between the diffusion and the dynamic organization of Kir channels may have important implications for channel function."
"Membrane curvature induced by proximity of anionic phospholipids can initiate endocytosis

The plasma membrane is uniquely enriched in phosphatidylserine (PtdSer). This anionic phospholipid is restricted almost exclusively to the inner leaflet of the plasmalemma. Because of their high density, the headgroups of anionic lipids experience electrostatic repulsion that, being exerted asymmetrically, is predicted to favor membrane curvature. We demonstrate that cholesterol limits this repulsion and tendency to curve. Removal of cholesterol or insertion of excess PtdSer increases the charge density of the inner leaflet, generating foci of enhanced charge and curvature where endophilin and synaptojanin are recruited. From these sites emerge tubules that undergo fragmentation, resulting in marked endocytosis of PtdSer. Shielding or reduction of the surface charge or imposition of outward membrane tension minimized invagination and PtdSer endocytosis. We propose that cholesterol associates with PtdSer to form nanodomains where the headgroups of PtdSer are maintained sufficiently separated to limit spontaneous curvature while sheltering the hydrophobic sterol from the aqueous medium.

Coarse-grained modeling of biomolecules has a very important role in molecular biology. In this work we present a novel SURPASS (Single United Residue per Pre-Averaged Secondary Structure fragment) model of proteins that can be an interesting alternative for existing coarse-grained models. The design of the model is unique and strongly supported by the statistical analysis of structural regularities characteristic for protein systems. Coarse-graining of protein chain structures assumes a single center of interactions per residue and accounts for preaveraged effects of four adjacent residue fragments. Knowledge-based statistical potentials encode complex interaction patterns of these fragments. Using the Replica Exchange Monte Carlo sampling scheme and a generic version of the SURPASS force field we performed test simulations of a representative set of single-domain globular proteins. The method samples a significant part of conformational space and reproduces protein structures, including native-like, with surprisingly good accuracy. Future extension of the SURPASS model on large biomacromolecular systems is briefly discussed.","Trametinib suppresses HIV-1 replication by interfering with the disassembly of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 capsid core

Our previous study showed that the phosphorylation of a highly conserved serine residue, Ser16 in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) capsid (CA) protein is promoted by virion-incorporated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) and required for proper peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (Pin1)-mediated uncoating. Interestingly, western blot analysis demonstrated that phosphorylated/activated mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2), the upstream activator of ERK2, as well as ERK2 are incorporated into virions. Here, we show that the MEK1/2 selective allosteric inhibitor Trametinib reduces HIV-1 infectivity via the decrease in virion-incorporated ERK2 phosphorylation. The treatment of chronic HIV-1-infected T-cell line, CEM/LAV- 1 cells with Trametinib results in a decrease in ERK2 phosphorylation in the virions. The viruses have relatively low infectivity and impaired reverse transcription. Cell-based fateof-capsid uncoating assay showed that the reduction in infectivity was caused by a functional impairment of the uncoating process. Furthermore, the viruses from Trametinib-treated CEM/LAV-1 cells also showed decreased reverse transcription efficiency and attenuated multiple rounds of replication in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Taken together, these findings suggest that Trametinib suppresses HIV-1 replication by abrogating the proper disassembly of CA core.

Cell membranes contain multiple lipid and protein components having heterogeneous in-plane (lateral) distribution. Nanoscale rafts are believed to play an important functional role, but their phase state—domains of coexisting phases or composition fluctuations—is unknown. As a step toward understanding lateral organization of cell membranes, we investigate the difference between nanoscale domains of coexisting phases and composition fluctuations in lipid bilayers. We simulate model lipid bilayers with the MARTINI coarse-grained force field on length scales of tens of nanometers and timescales of tens of microseconds. We use a binary and a ternary mixture: a saturated and an unsaturated lipid, or a saturated lipid, an unsaturated lipid, and cholesterol, respectively. In these mixtures, the phase behavior can be tuned from a mixed state to a coexistence of a liquid-crystalline and a gel, or a liquid-ordered and a liquid-disordered phase. Transition from a two-phase to a one-phase state is achieved by raising the temperature and adding a hybrid lipid (with a saturated and an unsaturated chain). We analyze the evolution of bilayer properties along this transition: domains of two phases transform to fluctuations with local ordering and compositional demixing. Nanoscale domains and fluctuations differ in several properties, including interleaflet overlap and boundary length. Hybrid lipids show no enrichment at the boundary, but decrease the difference between the coexisting phases by ordering the disordered phase, which could explain their role in cell membranes.
","Generalization of the swelling method to measure the intrinsic curvature of lipids
I. A. Barragan Vidal and M. Muller 
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5001858

Via computer simulation of a coarse-grained model of two-component lipid bilayers, we compare two methods of measuring the intrinsic curvatures of the constituting monolayers. The first one is a generalization of the swelling method that, in addition to the assumption that the spontaneous curvature linearly depends on the composition of the lipid mixture, incorporates contributions from its elastic energy. The second method measures the effective curvature-composition coupling between the apposing leaflets of bilayer structures (planar bilayers or cylindrical tethers) to extract the spontaneous curvature. Our findings demonstrate that both methods yield consistent results. However, we highlight that the two-leaflet structure inherent to the latter method has the advantage of allowing measurements for mixed lipid systems up to their critical point of demixing as well as in the regime of high concentration (of either species)."
"Insight into the interactions, residue snorkeling, and membrane disordering potency of a single antimicrobial peptide into different lipid bilayers

Pardaxin, with a bend-helix-bend-helix structure, is a membrane-active antimicrobial peptide that its membrane activity depends on the lipid bilayer composition. Herein, all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to provide further molecular insight into the interactions, structural dynamics, orientation behavior, and cationic residues snorkeling of pardaxin in the DMPC, DPPC, POPC, POPG, POPG/POPE (3:1), and POPG/ POPE (1:3) lipid bilayers. The results showed that the C-terminal helix of the peptide was maintained in all six types of the model-bilayers and pardaxin was tilted into the DMPC, DPPC, and POPG/POPE mixed bilayers more than the POPC and POPG bilayers. As well as, the structure of zwitterionic membranes was more affected by the peptide than the anionic bilayers. Taken together, the study demonstrated that the cationic residues of pardaxin snorkeled toward the interface of lipid bilayers and all phenylalanine residues of the peptide played important roles in the peptide-membrane interactions. We hope that this work will provide a better understanding of the interactions of antimicrobial peptides with the membranes","Snead, W.T., C.C. Hayden, A.K. Gadok, C. Zhao, E.M. Lafer, P. Rangamani, and J.C. Stachowiak. 2017. Membrane fission by protein crowding. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 114: E3258–E3267.

Membrane fission, which facilitates compartmentalization of biological processes into discrete, membrane-bound volumes, is essential for cellular life. Proteins with specific structural features including constricting rings, helical scaffolds, and hydrophobic membrane insertions are thought to be the primary drivers of fission. In contrast, here we report a mechanism of fission that is independent of protein structure-steric pressure among membrane-bound proteins. In particular, random collisions among crowded proteins generate substantial pressure, which if unbalanced on the opposite membrane surface can dramatically increase membrane curvature, leading to fission. Using the endocytic protein epsin1 N-terminal homology domain (ENTH), previously thought to drive fission by hydrophobic insertion, our results show that membrane coverage correlates equally with fission regardless of the hydrophobicity of insertions. Specifically, combining FRET-based measurements of membrane coverage with multiple, independent measurements of membrane vesiculation revealed that fission became spontaneous as steric pressure increased. Further, fission efficiency remained equally potent when helices were replaced by synthetic membrane-binding motifs. These data challenge the view that hydrophobic insertions drive membrane fission, suggesting instead that the role of insertions is to anchor proteins strongly to membrane surfaces, amplifying steric pressure. In line with these conclusions, even green fluorescent protein (GFP) was able to drive fission efficiently when bound to the membrane at high coverage. Our conclusions are further strengthened by the finding that intrinsically disordered proteins, which have large hydrodynamic radii yet lack a defined structure, drove fission with substantially greater potency than smaller, structured proteins.","An Adaptable Phospholipid Membrane Mimetic System for Solution NMR Studies of Membrane Proteins

Based on the saposin-A (SapA) scaffold protein, we demonstrate the suitability of a size-adaptable phospholipid membrane-mimetic system for solution NMR studies of membrane proteins (MPs) under closeto-native conditions. The Salipro nanoparticle size can be tuned over a wide pH range by adjusting the saposin-tolipid stoichiometry, enabling maintenance of sufficiently high amounts of phospholipid in the Salipro nanoparticle to mimic a realistic membrane environment while controlling the overall size to enable solution NMR for a range of MPs. Three representative MPs, including one Gprotein-coupled receptor, were successfully incorporated into SapA-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine nanoparticles and studied by solution NMR spectroscopy
","Regulation of Contraction by the Thick Filaments in Skeletal Muscle

Contraction of skeletal muscle cells is initiated by a well-known signaling pathway. An action potential in a motor nerve triggers an action potential in a muscle cell membrane, a transient increase of intracellular calcium concentration, binding of calcium to troponin in the actin-containing thin filaments, and a structural change in the thin filaments that allows myosin motors from the thick filaments to bind to actin and generate force. This calcium/thin filament mediated pathway provides the “START” signal for contraction, but it is argued that the functional response of the muscle cell, including the speed of its contraction and relaxation, adaptation to the external load, and the metabolic cost of contraction is largely determined by additional mechanisms. This review considers the role of the thick filaments in those mechanisms, and puts forward a paradigm for the control of contraction in skeletal muscle in which both the thick and thin filaments have a regulatory function. The OFF state of the thick filament is characterized by helical packing of most of the myosin head or motor domains on the thick filament surface in a conformation that makes them unavailable for actin binding or ATP hydrolysis, although a small fraction of the myosin heads are constitutively ON. The availability of the majority fraction of the myosin heads for contraction is controlled in part by the external load on the muscle, so that these heads only attach to actin and hydrolyze ATP when they are required. This phenomenon seems to be the major determinant of the well-known force-velocity relationship of muscle, and controls the metabolic cost of contraction. The regulatory state of the thick filament also seems to control the dynamics of both muscle activation and relaxation.

The naturally occurring milk sphingomyelin is of particular interest owing to its complex composition and involvement in the formation of the milk fat globule membrane (MFGM). Knowledge of membrane organization and nanomechanical stability has proved to be crucial in understanding their properties and functions. In this work, two model membrane systems composed of 1, 2 dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), egg sphingomyelin (egg-SM) and cholesterol, and DOPC, milk sphingomyelin (milk-SM) and cholesterol were exposed to both RT and 10 °C. The morphological and nanomechanical changes were investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging and force mapping below RT using a designed liquid cell with temperature-control. In both systems, the size and shape of SM/Chol-enriched liquid ordered domains (Lo) and DOPC-enriched liquid disordered phase (Ld) were monitored at controlled temperatures. AFM based force-mapping showed that rupture forces were consistently higher for Lo domains than Ld phases and were decreased for Ld with decreasing temperature while an increase in breakthrough force was observed in Lo domains. More interestingly, dynamic changes and defect formations in the hydrated lipid bilayers were mostly detected at low temperature, suggesting a rearrangement of lipid molecules to relieve additional tension introduced upon cooling. Noteworthy, in these model membrane systems, tension-driven defects generally heal on reheating the sample. The results of this work bring new insights to low temperature induced membrane structural reorganization and mechanical stability changes which will bring us one step closer to understand more complex systems such as the MFGM."
"Open Boundary Simulations of Proteins and Their Hydration Shells by Hamiltonian Adaptive Resolution Scheme
Tareni, T,; Calandrini, V.; Potesti, R.; Giorgetti, A.; Carloni, P. JCTC
DOI:10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00508

The recently proposed Hamiltonian adaptive resolution scheme (HAdResS) allows the performance of molecular simulations in an open boundary framework. It allows changing, on the fly, the resolution of specific subsets of molecules (usually the solvent), which are free to diffuse between the atomistic region and the coarse-grained reservoir. So far, the method has been successfully applied to pure liquids. Coupling the H-AdResS methodology to hybrid models of proteins, such as the molecular mechanics/coarse-grained (MM/CG) scheme, is a promising approach for rigorous calculations of ligand binding free energies in low-resolution protein models. Toward this goal, here we apply for the first time H-AdResS to two atomistic proteins in dualresolution solvent, proving its ability to reproduce structural and dynamic properties of both the proteins and the solvent, as obtained from atomistic simulations.","Membrane vesiculation induced by proteins of the dengue virus envelope studied by molecular dynamics simulations

Biological membranes are continuously remodeled in the cell by specific membrane-shaping machineries to form, for example, tubes and vesicles. We examine fundamental mechanisms involved in the vesiculation processes induced by a cluster of envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins of the dengue virus (DENV) using molecular dynamics simulations and a coarse-grained model. We show that an arrangement of three E-M heterotetramers (EM3) works as a bending unit and an ordered cluster of five such units generates a closed vesicle, reminiscent of the virus budding process. In silico mutagenesis of two charged residues of the anchor helices of the envelope proteins of DENV shows that Arg-471 and Arg-60 are fundamental to produce bending stress on the membrane. The fine-tuning between the size of the EM3 unit and its specific bending action suggests this protein unit is an important factor in determining the viral particle size.

Activation of transmembrane receptor integrin by talin is essential for inducing cell adhesion. However, the pathway that recruits talin to the membrane, which critically controls talin’s action, remains elusive. Membrane-anchored mammalian small GTPase Rap1 is known to bind talin-F0 domain but the binding was shown to be weak and thus hardly studied. Here we show structurally that talin-F0 binds to human Rap1b like canonical Rap1 effectors despite little sequence homology, and disruption of the binding strongly impairs integrin activation, cell adhesion, and cell spreading. Furthermore, while being weak in conventional binary binding conditions, the Rap1b/talin interaction becomes strong upon attachment of activated Rap1b to vesicular membranes that mimic the agonist-induced microenvironment. These data identify a crucial Rap1-mediated membrane-targeting mechanism for talin to activate integrin. They further broadly caution the analyses of weak protein–protein interactions that may be pivotal for function but neglected in the absence of specific cellular microenvironments.","Adaptive Finite Temperature String Method in Collective Variables

Here we present a modified version of the on-the-fly string method for the localization of the minimum free energy path in a space of arbitrary collective variables. In the proposed approach the shape of the biasing potential is controlled by only two force constants, defining the width of the potential along the string and orthogonal to it. The force constants and the distribution of the string nodes are optimized during the simulation, improving the convergence. The optimized parameters can be used for umbrella sampling with a path CV along the converged string as the reaction coordinate. We test the new method with three fundamentally different processes: chloride attack to chloromethane in bulk water, alanine dipeptide isomerization, and the enzymatic conversion of isochorismate to piruvate. In each case the same set of parameters resulted in a rapidly converging simulation and a precise estimation of the potential of mean force. Therefore, the default settings can be used for a wide range of processes, making the method essentially parameter free and more user-friendly.

Actin polymerization provides driving force to aid several types of processes that involve pulling the plasma membrane into the cell, including phagocytosis, cellular entry of large viruses, and endocytosis. In endocytosis, actin polymerization is especially important under conditions of high membrane tension or high turgor pressure. Recent modeling efforts have shown how actin polymerization can give rise to a distribution of forces around the endocytic site, and explored how these forces affect the shape dynamics; experiments have revealed the structure of the endocytic machinery in increasing detail, and demonstrated key feedback interactions between actin assembly and membrane curvature. Here we provide a perspective on these findings and suggest avenues for future research."

We present a new force field and development scheme for atomistic simulations of materials under extreme conditions. These models, which explicitly include two- and three-body interactions, are generated by fitting linear combinations of Chebyshev polynomials through force matching to trajectories from Kohn–Sham density functional theory (DFT). We apply our method to liquid carbon near the diamond/graphite/liquid triple point and at higher densities and temperatures, where metallization and many-body effects may be substantial. We show that explicit inclusion of three-body interaction terms allows our model to yield improved descriptions of both dynamic and structural properties over previous empirical potential efforts, while exhibiting transferability to nearby state points. The simplicity of our functional form and subsequent efficiency of parameter determination allow for extension of DFT to experimental time and length scales while retaining most of its accuracy.","Parallel Tempering of Dark Matter from the Ebola Virus Proteome: Comparison of CHARMM36m and CHARMM22 Force Fields with Implicit Solvent Mark A. Olson
J. Chem. Inf. Model., Just Accepted Manuscript (2017) doi: 10.1021/acs.jcim.7b00517
Intrinsically disordered proteins are characterized by their large manifold of thermally accessible conformations and their related statistical weights making them an interesting target of simulation studies. To assess the development of a computational framework for modeling this distinct class of proteins, this work examines temperature-based replica exchange simulations to generate a conformational ensemble of a 28-residue peptide from the Ebola virus protein VP35. Starting from a prefolded helix-β-turn-helix topology observed in a crystallographic assembly, the simulation strategy tested is the recently refined CHARMM36m force field combined with a generalized Born solvent model. A comparison is provided of two replica exchange methods where one is a traditional approach of a fixed set of temperatures and the other is an adaptive scheme of allowing the thermal windows to move in temperature space. The assessment is further extended to include a comparison to equivalent CHARMM22 simulation datasets. The analysis finds CHARMM36m to shift the minimum in the potential of mean force (PMF) to a lower fractional helicity as compared to CHARMM22, while the later showed greater conformational plasticity along the helix-forming reaction coordinate. Among the simulation models, only the adaptive tempering method with CHARMM36m found an ensemble of conformational heterogeneity consisting of transitions between α-helix-β-hairpin folds and unstructured states that produced a PMF of fractional fold propensity in qualitative agreement with circular dichroism experiments of reporting a disordered peptide.

ABSTRACT: Classical density functional theory (DFT) can be used to relate the thermodynamic properties of solutions to the indirect solvent mediated part of the solute-solvent potential of mean force (PMF). Standard, but powerful numerical methods can be used to estimate the solute-solvent PMF from which the indirect part can be extracted. In this work we show how knowledge of the direct and indirect parts of the solute-solvent PMF for water at the interface of a protein receptor can be used to gain insights about how to design tighter binding ligands. As we show, the indirect part of the solute-solvent PMF is equal to the sum of the 1-body (energy + entropy) terms in the inhomogeneous solvation theory (IST) expansion of the solvation free energy. To illustrate the effect of displacing interfacial water molecules with particular direct/indirect PMF signatures on the binding of ligands, we carry out simulations of protein binding with several pairs of congeneric ligands. We show that interfacial water locations that contribute favorably or unfavorably at the 1-body level (energy + entropy) to the solvation free energy of the solute can be targeted as part of the ligand design process. Water locations where the indirect PMF is larger in magnitude provide better targets for displacement when adding a functional group to a ligand core.","Nanomechanics of actin filament: A molecular dynamics simulation

Actin is known as the most abundant essentially protein in eukaryotic cells. Actin plays a crucial role in many cellular processes involving mechanical forces such as cell motility, adhesion, muscle contraction and intracellular transport. However, little is known about the mechanical properties of this protein when subjected to mechanical forces in cellular processes. In this paper, a series of large-scale molecular dynamics simulations are carried out to elucidate nanomechanical behavior such as elastic and viscoelastic properties of a single actin filament. Here, we used two individual methods namely, all-atoms and coarse grained molecular dynamics, to evaluate elastic properties of a single actin filament. In the other word, based on Brownian motions of the filament and by employing the principle of the equipartition theorem, in aqueous solution, tensile stiffness, torsional rigidity and bending rigidity of the single actin filament are studied. The results revealed that increasing the sampling window time leads to convergence of obtained mechanical properties to the experimental values. Moreover, in order to investigate viscoelastic properties of a single actin filament, constant force steered molecular dynamics method is used to apply different external tensile loads and perform five individual creep tests on the molecule. The strain-time response of the filament for each creep test is obtained. Based on the Kelvin-Voigt model, the results reveal that a single actin filament shows a nonlinear viscoelastic behavior, with a Young's modulus of 2.85 GPa, a viscosity of 4.06 GPa.ns, and a relaxation time in the range of 1.42 ns which were measured here for the first time at the single filament level. The findings of this paper suggest that molecular dynamics simulations could also be a useful tool for investigating the mechanical behavior of bio-nanomaterials.

"Overfill Protection and Hyperdynamics in Adaptively Biased Simulations
Bradley M. Dickson
Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation Article ASAP
DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00821
Two problems associated with adaptively biased simulations are considered: overfilling and time scale estimation. First, a simple and computationally efficient procedure for limiting the bias fill-depth of any adaptive biasing potential is introduced. The resulting bias potential floods only up to a specified level and avoids bias accumulation in higher regions of free energy. Second, hyperdynamics can be invoked in combination with this depth-limited bias potential to estimate time scales. We argue that allowing the bias to equilibrate to a set depth is one crux in efficient hyperdynamics application. In both simple (alanine dipeptide) and complex (ligand residence) test cases, the useable boost factors are 6–8 times larger when the bias fill depth is directly controlled, as opposed to controlling the update frequency. Update frequency has emerged as a proxy for controlling the fill height of adaptive biases, with infrequent metadynamics being an example. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test is shown to be insufficient for determining the trustworthiness of a hyperdynamics simulation, and a more robust strategy is described. Overfill limiting and hyperdynamics have been added to the fABMACS project.","Simultaneous Determination of Protein Structure and Dynamics Using Cryo-Electron Microscopy

bioRxiv (2017) doi: 10.1101/219972
Cryo-electron microscopy is rapidly emerging as a powerful technique to determine the structures of complex macromolecular systems elusive to other techniques. Since many of these systems are highly dynamical, characterising also their movements is a crucial step to unravel their biological functions. To achieve this goal, we report an integrative modelling approach to simultaneously determine structure and dynamics from cryo-electron microscopy density maps. By quantifying the level of noise in the data and dealing with their ensemble-averaged nature, this approach enables the integration of multiple sources of information to model ensembles of structures and infer their populations. We illustrate the method by characterising structure and dynamics of the integral membrane receptor STRA6, thus providing insights into the mechanisms by which it interacts with retinol binding protein and translocates retinol across the membrane.

ABSTRACT: Protein cavities and tunnels are critical for function. Ligand recognition and binding, transport and enzyme catalysis require cavities rearrangements. Therefore, the flexibility of cavities should be guaranteed by protein vibrational dynamics. Molecular dynamics simulations provide a framework to explore conformational plasticity of protein cavities. Herein, we present a novel procedure to characterize the dynamics of protein cavities in terms of their volume gradient vector. For this purpose, we make use of algorithms for calculation of the cavity volume that result robust for numerical differentiations. Volume gradient vector is expressed in terms of principal component analysis obtained from equilibrated molecular dynamics simulations. We analyze contributions of principal component modes to the volume gradient vector according to their frequency and degree of delocalization. In all our test cases, we find that low frequency modes play a critical role together with minor contributions of high frequency modes. These modes involve concerted motions of significant fractions of the total residues lining the cavities. We make use of variations of the potential energy of a protein in the direction of the volume gradient vector as a measure of flexibility of the cavity. We show that proteins whose collective low frequency fluctuations contribute the most to changes of cavity volume exhibit more flexible cavities.","Mesoscopic-microscopic spatial stochastic simulation with automatic system partitioning

The reaction-diffusion master equation (RDME) is a model that allows for efficient on-lattice simulation of spatially resolved stochastic chemical kinetics. Compared to off-lattice hard-sphere simulations with Brownian dynamics or Green’s function reaction dynamics, the RDME can be orders of magnitude faster if the lattice spacing can be chosen coarse enough. However, strongly diffusion-controlled reactions mandate a very fine mesh resolution for acceptable accuracy. It is common that reactions in the same model differ in their degree of diffusion control and therefore require different degrees of mesh resolution. This renders mesoscopic simulation inefficient for systems with multiscale properties. Mesoscopic-microscopic hybrid methods address this problem by resolving the most challenging reactions with a microscale, off-lattice simulation. However, all methods to date require manual partitioning of a system, effectively limiting their usefulness as “black-box” simulation codes. In this paper, we propose a hybrid simulation algorithm with automatic system partitioning based on indirect a priori error estimates. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the method on models of diffusion-controlled networks in 3D."
"Temperature-shuffled parallel cascade selection molecular dynamics accelerates the structural transitions of proteins
Harada, Ryuhei and Shigeta, Yasuteru Journal of Computational Chemistry 38 31 10.1002/jcc.25060
Parallel cascade selection molecular dynamics (PaCS-MD) is an enhanced conformational sampling method for searching structural transition pathways from a given reactant to a product. Recently, a temperature-aided PaCS-MD (Vinod et al., Eur. Biophys. J. 2016, 45, 463) has been proposed as its extension, in which the temperatures were introduced as additional parameters in conformational resampling, whereas the temperature is fixed in the original PaCS-MD. In the present study, temperature-shuffled PaCS-MD is proposed as a further extension of temperature-aided PaCS-MD in which the temperatures are shuffled among different replicas at the beginning of each cycle of conformational resampling. To evaluate their conformational sampling efficiencies, the original, temperature-aided, and temperature-shuffled PaCS-MD were applied to a protein-folding process of Trp-cage, and their minimum computational costs to identify the native state were addressed. Through the evaluation, it was confirmed that temperature-shuffled PaCS-MD remarkably accelerated the protein-folding process of Trp-cage compared with the other methods. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."," Zhou, H.; Tao, P.; Dynamics Sampling in Transition Pathway Space; Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation 2017, 10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00606.
ABSTRACT: The minimum energy pathway contains important information describing the transition between two states on a potential energy surface (PES). Chain-of-states methods were developed to efficiently calculate minimum energy pathways connecting two stable states. In the chain-of-states framework, a series of structures are generated and optimized to represent the minimum energy pathway connecting two states. However, multiple pathways may exist connecting two existing states, and should be identified to obtain a full view of the transitions. Therefore, we developed an enhanced sampling method, named as the direct pathway dynamics sampling (DPDS) method, to facilitate exploration of a PES for multiple pathways connecting two stable states as well as addition minima and their associated transition pathways. In the DPDS method, molecular dynamics simulations are carried out on the targeting PES within a chain-of-states framework to directly sample the transition pathway space. The simulations of DPDS could be regulated by two parameters controlling distance among states along the pathway and smoothness of the pathway. One advantage of the chain-of-states framework is that no specific reaction coordinates are necessary to generate the reaction pathway, because such information is implicitly represented by the structures along the pathway. The chain-of-states setup in a DPDS method greatly enhances the sufficient sampling in high-energy space between two end states, such as transition states. By removing the constraint on the end states of the pathway, DPDS will also sample pathways connecting minima on a PES in addition to the endpoints of starting pathway. This feature makes DPDS an ideal method to directly explore transition pathway space. Three examples demonstrate the efficiency of DPDS methods in sampling the high-energy area important for reactions on the PES.

R.; New angles on standard force fields: towards a general approach for treating atomic-level; Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation 2017, 10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00851.
ABSTRACT: Nearly all standard force fields employ the 'sum-of-spheres' approximation, which models intermolecular interactions purely in terms of interatomic distances. Nonetheless, atoms in molecules can have significantly non-spherical shapes, leading to interatomic interaction energies with strong orientation dependencies. Neglecting this 'atomic-level anisotropy' can lead to significant errors in predicting interaction energies. Herein we propose a simple, transferable, and computationally-efficient model (MASTIFF) whereby atomic-level orientation dependence can be incorporated into ab initio intermolecular force fields. \mastiff includes anisotropic exchange-repulsion, charge penetration, and dispersion effects, in conjunction with a standard treatment of anisotropic long-range (multipolar) electrostatics. To validate our approach, we benchmark \mastiff against various sum-of-spheres models over a large library of intermolecular interactions between small organic molecules. MASTIFF achieves quantitative accuracy with respect to both high-level electronic structure theory and experiment, thus showing promise as a basis for 'next-generation' force field development.","A Rejection Scheme for Off-Lattice Kinetic Monte Carlo Simulation

We introduce a new kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) algorithm for
off-lattice simulation. In off-lattice KMC, one needs to calculate
the rates for all possible moves from the current state by
searching the energy landscape for index 1 saddle points
surrounding the current basin of attraction. We introduce a
rejection scheme in which the true rates are replaced by rate
estimates. This is done by first associating each saddle point
with the atom that would move the most if that transition were to
take place and then constructing an estimate for the total rate
associated with each atom by using a nearest-neighbor bond count.
These estimates allow one to select a set of possible transitions,
one of which is accepted or rejected on the basis of a localized
saddle point search focused on a particular atom. In principle,
this allows a performance boost that scales with the number of
particles in the system. We test the method on a growing
two-species nanocluster and find we can reduce the computation
time by 90% for clusters that contain ∼55 particles and 96% for
clusters that contain ∼65 particles."

ABSTRACT: Macromolecular systems are composed of a very large number of atomic degrees of freedom. There is strong evidence suggesting that structural changes occurring in large biomolecular systems at long timescale dynamics may be captured by models coarser than atomistic, although a suitable or optimal coarse-graining is a priori unknown. Here we propose a systematic approach to learning a coarse representation of a macromolecule from microscopic simulation data. In particular, the definition of effective coarse variables is achieved by partitioning the degrees of freedom both in the structural (physical) space, and in the conformational space. The identification of groups of microscopic particles forming dynamical coherent states in different metastable states leads to a multiscale description of the system, in space and time. The application of this approach to the folding dynamics of two proteins provides a revised view of the classical idea of pre-structured regions (foldons) that combine during a protein folding process, and suggests a hierarchical characterization of the assembly process of folded structures.","(1)  Buckles, T.

In this Letter, we have extended the emerging framework of stochastic thermodynamics to active matter. In particular, for the active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model, we have provided consistent definitions of thermodynamic quantities such as work, energy, heat, entropy, and entropy production at the level of single, stochastic trajectories and derived related fluctuation relations.

ABSTRACT: Predicting pKa values for different types of amine species with high accuracy and efficiency is of critical importance for the design of high performance and economical solvents in carbon capture and storage with aqueous amine solutions. In this study, we demonstrate that density-functional tight-binding (DFTB) metadynamics simulations are a promising approach to calculate the free energy difference between the protonated and neutral states of amines in aqueous solution with inexpensive computational cost. The calculated pKa values were in satisfactory agreement with the experimental values, the mean absolute deviation being only 0.08 pKa units for 34 amines commonly used in CO2 scrubbing. Such superior reproducibility and correlation compared to estimations by static quantum mechanical calculations highlight the significant effect of dynamical proton transfer processes in explicit solvent molecules for the improvement of the estimation accuracy. Note that the accuracy of the estimated pKa might be dependent on the adopted systems, due to the limitation of the DFTB parameter.","BOCS: Bottom-Up Open-Source Coarse-Graining Software

We present the BOCS toolkit as a suite of open source software tools for parameterizing bottom-up coarse-grained (CG) models to accurately reproduce structural and thermodynamic properties of high resolution models. The BOCS toolkit complements available software packages by providing robust implementations of both the multiscale coarse-graining (MS-CG) force-matching method and also the generalized-Yvon-Born-Green (g-YBG) method. The g-YBG method allows one to analyze and to calculate MS-CG potentials in terms of structural correlations. Additionally, the BOCS toolkit implements an extended ensemble framework for optimizing the transferabil- ity of bottom-up potentials, as well as a self-consistent pressure-matching method for accurately modeling the pressure equation of state for homogeneous systems. We illustrate these capabilities by parameterizing transferable potentials for CG models that accurately model the structure, pressure, and compressibility of liquid alkane systems and by quantifying the role of many-body correlations in determining the calculated pair potential for a one-site CG model of liquid methanol.

Understanding capsid assembly is important because of its role in virus lifecycles and in applications to drug discovery and nanomaterial development. Many virus capsids are icosahedral, and assembly is thought to occur by the sequential addition of capsid protein subunits to a nucleus, with the final step completing the icosahedron. Almost nothing is known about the final (completion) step because the techniques usually used to study capsid assembly lack the resolution. In this work, charge detection mass spectrometry (CDMS) has been used to track the assembly of the T = 4 hepatitis B virus (HBV) capsid in real time. The initial assembly reaction occurs rapidly, on the time scale expected from low resolution measurements. However, CDMS shows that many of the particles generated in this process are defective and overgrown, containing more than the 120 capsid protein dimers needed to form a perfect T = 4 icosahedron. The defective and overgrown capsids self-correct over time to the mass expected for a perfect T = 4 capsid. Thus, completion is a distinct phase in the assembly reaction. Capsid completion does not necessarily occur by inserting the last building block into an incomplete, but otherwise perfect icosahedron. The initial assembly reaction can be predominently imperfect, and completion involves the slow correction of the accumulated errors.",

Abstract;
With the rapid increase of available data for complex systems, there is great interest in the extraction of physically relevant information from massive datasets. Recently, a framework called Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) has been introduced to identify the governing equations of dynamical systems from simulation data. In this study, we extend SINDy to stochastic dynamical systems, which are frequently used to model biophysical processes. We prove the asymptotic correctness of stochastics SINDy in the infinite data limit, both in the original and projected variables. We discuss algorithms to solve the sparse regression problem arising from the practical implementation of SINDy, and show that cross validation is an essential tool to determine the right level of sparsity. We demonstrate the proposed methodology on two test systems, namely, the diffusion in a one-dimensional potential, and the projected dynamics of a two-dimensional diffusion process.","Water's Thermal Pressure Drives the Temperature Dependence of Hydrophobic Hydration

With the aid of literature experimental data and reported results from molecular simulation, two thermodynamic relations are found to provide a theoretical basis for the understanding of a variety of characteristic features associated with the solvation of small nonpolar molecules in water. Thus, the large and positive solvation heat capacity, enthalpy-entropy compensation, the solubility minimum and solvation free energy maximum with respect to temperature, enthalpy convergence, and entropy convergence are rationalized in a unified way. Our key finding is that all of these phenomena are driven by the thermal pressure coefficient of pure water, which, via the isobaric thermal expansivity and the isothermal compressibility, reflects its unusual thermodynamics. Remarkably, the solubility minimum is found to be a direct consequence of water's density maximum.","Sorrenti, A., J. Leira-Iglesias, A.J. Markvoort, T.F.A. de Greef, and T.M. Hermans. 2017. Non-equilibrium supramolecular polymerization. Chem. Soc. Rev. 46: 5476–5490.

Supramolecular polymerization has been traditionally focused on the thermodynamic equilibrium state, where one-dimensional assemblies reside at the global minimum of the Gibbs free energy. The pathway and rate to reach the equilibrium state are irrelevant, and the resulting assemblies remain unchanged over time. In the past decade, the focus has shifted to kinetically trapped (non-dissipative non-equilibrium) structures that heavily depend on the method of preparation (i.e., pathway complexity), and where the assembly rates are of key importance. Kinetic models have greatly improved our understanding of competing pathways, and shown how to steer supramolecular polymerization in the desired direction (i.e., pathway selection). The most recent innovation in the field relies on energy or mass input that is dissipated to keep the system away from the thermodynamic equilibrium (or from other non-dissipative states). This tutorial review aims to provide the reader with a set of tools to identify different types of self-assembled states that have been explored so far. In particular, we aim to clarify the often unclear use of the term ‘‘non-equilibrium self-assembly’’ by subdividing systems into dissipative, and non-dissipative non-equilibrium states. Examples are given for each of the states, with a focus on non-dissipative non-equilibrium states found in one-dimensional supramolecular polymerization.",

Maturation of HIV-1 particles encompasses a complex morphological transformation of Gag via an orchestrated series of proteolytic cleavage events. A longstanding question concerns the structure of the C-terminal region of CA and the peptide SP1 (CA–SP1), which represents an intermediate during maturation of the HIV-1 virus. By integrating NMR, cryo-EM, and molecular dynamics simulations, we show that in CA–SP1 tubes assembled in vitro, which represent the features of an intermediate assembly state during maturation, the SP1 peptide exists in a dynamic helix–coil equilibrium, and that the addition of the maturation inhibitors Bevirimat and DFH-055 causes stabilization of a helical form of SP1. Moreover, the maturation-arresting SP1 mutation T8I also induces helical structure in SP1 and further global dynamical and conformational changes in CA. Overall, our results show that dynamics of CA and SP1 are critical for orderly HIV-1 maturation and that small molecules can inhibit maturation by perturbing molecular motions.","Maximum Caliber: a general variational principle for dynamical systems

arXiv:1711.03450

Abstract:
We review here {\it Maximum Caliber} (Max Cal), a general variational principle for inferring distributions of paths in dynamical processes and networks. Max Cal is to dynamical trajectories what the principle of {\it Maximum Entropy} (Max Ent) is to equilibrium states or stationary populations. In Max Cal, you maximize a path entropy over all possible pathways, subject to dynamical constraints, in order to predict relative path weights. Many well-known relationships of Non-Equilibrium Statistical Physics -- such as the Green-Kubo fluctuation-dissipation relations, Onsager's reciprocal relations, and Prigogine's Minimum Entropy Production -- are limited to near-equilibrium processes. Max Cal is more general. While it can readily derive these results under those limits, Max Cal is also applicable far from equilibrium. We give recent examples of MaxCal as a method of inference about trajectory distributions from limited data, finding reaction coordinates in bio-molecular simulations, and modeling the complex dynamics of non-thermal systems such as gene regulatory networks or the collective firing of neurons. We also survey its basis in principle, and some limitations.","Testing the mutual information expansion of entropy with multivariate Gaussian distributions
Martin Goethe, Ignacio Fita, and J. Miguel Rubi  The Journal of Chemical Physics  2017  147:22
               
The mutual information expansion (MIE) represents an approximation of the configurational entropy in terms of low-dimensional integrals. It is frequently employed to compute entropies from simulation data of large systems, such as macromolecules, for which brute-force evaluation of the full configurational integral is intractable. Here, we test the validity of MIE for systems consisting of more than m = 100 degrees of freedom (dofs). The dofs are distributed according to multivariate Gaussian distributions which were generated from protein structures using a variant of the anisotropic network model. For the Gaussian distributions, we have semi-analytical access to the configurational entropy as well as to all contributions of MIE. This allows us to accurately assess the validity of MIE for different situations. We find that MIE diverges for systems containing long-range correlations which means that the error of consecutive MIE approximations grows with the truncation order n for all tractable n ≪ m. This fact implies severe limitations on the applicability of MIE, which are discussed in the article. For systems with correlations that decay exponentially with distance, MIE represents an asymptotic expansion of entropy, where the first successive MIE approximations approach the exact entropy, while MIE also diverges for larger orders. In this case, MIE serves as a useful entropy expansion when truncated up to a specific truncation order which depends on the correlation length of the system.

The t-SNARE complex plays a central role in neuronal fusion. Its components, syntaxin-1 and SNAP25, are largely present in individual clusters and partially colocalize at the presumptive fusion site. How these protein clusters modify local lipid composition and membrane morphology is largely unknown. In this work, using coarse-grained molecular dynamics, the transmembrane domains (TMDs) of t-SNARE complexes are shown to form aggregates leading to formation of lipid nanodomains, which are enriched in cholesterol, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, and gangliosidic lipids. These nano-domains induce membrane curvature that would promote a closer contact between vesicle and plasma membrane.

Membrane fusion in eukaryotic cells mediates the biogenesis of organelles, vesicular traffic between them, and exo- and endocytosis of important signalling molecules, such as hormones and neurotransmitters. Distinct tasks in intracellular membrane fusion have been assigned to conserved protein systems. Tethering proteins mediate the initial recognition and attachment of membranes, whereas SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) protein complexes are considered as the core fusion engine. SNARE complexes provide mechanical energy to distort membranes and drive them through a hemifusion intermediate towards the formation of a fusion pore1,2,3. This last step is highly energy-demanding4,5. Here we combine the in vivo and in vitro fusion of yeast vacuoles with molecular simulations to show that tethering proteins are critical for overcoming the final energy barrier to fusion pore formation. SNAREs alone drive vacuoles only into the hemifused state. Tethering proteins greatly increase the volume of SNARE complexes and deform the site of hemifusion, which lowers the energy barrier for pore opening and provides the driving force. Thereby, tethering proteins assume a crucial mechanical role in the terminal stage of membrane fusion that is likely to be conserved at multiple steps of vesicular traffic. We therefore propose that SNAREs and tethering proteins should be considered as a single, non-dissociable device that drives fusion. The core fusion machinery may then be larger and more complex than previously thought.","Nonadiabatic semiclassical dynamics in the mixed quantum-classical initial value representation Matthew S.

We introduce an efficient symplectic integration scheme, the MInt algorithm, for numerical time evolution of the phase space variables and monodromy matrix under the non-separable MMST Hamiltonian. We then calculate the probability of transmission through a curve crossing in model two-level systems and show that MQC-IVR reproduces quantum-limit semiclassical results in good agreement with exact quantum methods in one limit, and in the other limit yields results that are in keeping with classical limit semiclassical methods like linearized IVR. Finally, exploiting the ability of the MQC-IVR to quantize different dofs to different extents, we present a detailed study of the extents to which quantizing the nuclear and electronic dofs improves numerical convergence properties without significant loss of accuracy.","Long-range coupling between ATP-binding and lever-arm regions in myosin via dielectric allostery

A protein molecule is a dielectric substance, so the binding of a ligand is expected to induce dielectric response in the protein molecule, considering that ligands are charged or polar in general. We previously reported that binding of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to molecular motor myosin actually induces such a dielectric response in myosin due to the net negative charge of ATP. By this dielectric response, referred to as “dielectric allostery,” spatially separated two regions in myosin, the ATP-binding region and the actin-binding region, are allosterically coupled. In this study, from the statistically stringent analyses of the extensive molecular dynamics simulation data obtained in the ATP-free and the ATP-bound states, we show that there exists the dielectric allostery that transmits the signal of ATP binding toward the distant lever-arm region. The ATP-binding-induced electrostatic potential change observed on the surface of the main domain induced a movement of the converter subdomain from which the lever arm extends. The dielectric response was found to be caused by an underlying large-scale concerted rearrangement of the electrostatic bond network, in which highly conserved charged/polar residues are involved. Our study suggests the importance of the dielectric property for molecular machines in exerting their function.","A master equation approach to actin polymerization applied to endocytosis in yeast

We present a Master Equation approach to calculating polymerization dynamics and force generation by branched actin networks at membranes. The method treats the time evolution of the F-actin distribution in three dimensions, with branching included as a directional spreading term. It is validated by comparison with stochastic simulations of force generation by actin polymerization at obstacles coated with actin “nucleation promoting factors” (NPFs). The method is then used to treat the dynamics of actin polymerization and force generation during endocytosis in yeast, using a model in which NPFs form a ring around the endocytic site, centered by a spot of molecules attaching the actin network strongly to the membrane. We find that a spontaneous actin filament nucleation mechanism is required for adequate forces to drive the process, that partial inhibition of branching and polymerization lead to different characteristic responses, and that a limited range of polymerization-rate values provide effective invagination and obtain correct predictions for the effects of mutations in the active regions of the NPFs.

The prediction of residue contacts in a protein solely from sequence information is a promising approach to computational structure prediction. Recent developments use statistical or information theoretic methods to extract contact information from a multiple sequence alignment. Despite good results, accuracy is limited due to usage of two-body interactions within a Potts model. In this paper we generalize this approach and propose a Hamiltonian with an additional three-body interaction term. We derive a mean-field approximation for inference of three-body couplings within a Potts model which is fast enough on modern computers. Finally, we show that our model has a higher accuracy in predicting residue contacts in comparison with the plain two-body-interaction model.","Quantum fluctuations of a fullerene cage modulate its internal magnetic environment

Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2018,20, 1673-1684 

To investigate the effect of quantum fluctuations on the magnetic environment inside a C60 fullerene cage, we have calculated the nuclear magnetic shielding constant of protons in H2@C60 and HD@C60 systems by on-the-fly ab initio path integral simulation, including both thermal and nuclear quantum effects. The most dominant upfield from an isolated hydrogen molecule occurs due to the diamagnetic current of the C60 cage, which is partly cancelled by the paramagnetic current, where the paramagnetic contribution is enlarged by the zero-point vibrational fluctuation of the C60 carbon backbone structure via a widely distributed HOMO–LUMO gap. This quantum modulation mechanism of the nuclear magnetic shielding constant is newly proposed. Because this quantum effect is independent of the difference between H2 and HD, the H2/HD isotope shift occurs in spite of the C60 cage. The nuclear magnetic constants computed for H2@C60 and HD@C60 are 32.047 and 32.081 ppm, respectively, which are in reasonable agreement with the corresponding values of 32.19 and 32.23 ppm estimated from the experimental values of the chemical shifts.","Adaptive enhanced sampling with a path-variable for the simulation of protein folding and aggregation

In this article, we present a novel adaptive enhanced sampling molecular dynamics (MD) method for the accelerated simulation of protein folding and aggregation. We introduce a path-variable L based on the un-biased momenta p and displacements dq for the definition of the bias s applied to the system and derive 3 algorithms: general adaptive bias MD, adaptive path-sampling, and a hybrid method which combines the first 2 methodologies. Through the analysis of the correlations between the bias and the un-biased gradient in the system, we find that the hybrid methodology leads to an improved force correlation and acceleration in the sampling of the phase space. We apply our method on SPC/E water, where we find a conservation of the average water structure. We then use our method to sample dialanine and the folding of TrpCage, where we find a good agreement with simulation data reported in the literature. Finally, we apply our methodologies on the initial stages of aggregation of a hexamer of Alzheimer’s amyloid β fragment 25-35 (Aβ 25-35) and find that transitions within the hexameric aggregate are dominated by entropic barriers, while we speculate that especially the conformation entropy plays a major role in the formation of the fibril as a rate limiting factor.","Learning Free Energy Landscapes Using Artificial Neural Networks
Hythem Sidky and Jonathan K. Whitmer
arXiv:1712.02840v1 [cond-mat.stat-mech]
Existing adaptive bias techniques, which seek to estimate free energies and physical properties from molecular simulations, are limited by their reliance on fixed kernels or basis sets which hinder their ability to efficiently conform to varied free energy landscapes. Further, user-specified parameters are in general non-intuitive, yet significantly affect the convergence rate and accuracy of the free energy estimate. Here we propose a novel method wherein artificial neural networks (ANNs) are used to develop an adaptive biasing potential which learns free energy landscapes. We demonstrate that this method is capable of rapidly adapting to complex free energy landscapes and is not prone to boundary or oscillation problems. The method is made robust to hyperparameters and overfitting through Bayesian regularization which penalizes network weights and auto-regulates the number of effective parameters in the network. ANN sampling represents a promising innovative approach which can resolve complex free energy landscapes in less time than conventional approaches while requiring minimal user input.

Poursina, M. & Anderson, K.S.

Multibody Syst Dyn (2017). https://doi.org/10.1007/s11044-017-9603-6

Adaptive coarse graining of highly complex biomolecular systems is conducted by either imposing constraints on the system model to generate a coarser model, or releasing certain constraints from it to create a higher fidelity one. This paper addresses some of the challenges of transitions to finer-scale models. It is shown that the kinetic energy associated with ignored modes of motion during the coarse graining process must be estimated and put back into the simulation. As such, unlike real mechanical systems, transitioning back to a finer biomolecular model may result in an infinite number of solutions. Herein, an optimization-based approach subject to the satisfaction of impulse–momentum balance and desired kinetic energy is presented to arrive at a physically meaningful state of the system immediately after the transition. In order to reduce the cost of formulating and solving this optimization problem, generalized velocities of the system are partitioned into two categories: independent joint velocities associated with the released joints, and dependent joint velocities associated with the rest of the joints. This paper further develops a divide-and-conquer algorithm to efficiently perform this partitioning process and express dependent velocities in terms of independent ones. The presented method is highly parallelizable and avoids the construction of the mass and Jacobian matrices of the entire system, resulting in a significant improvement in computational efficiency.","Coupling discrete and continuum concentration particle models for multiscale and hybrid molecular-continuum simulations

Abstract:
Hybrid molecular-continuum simulation techniques afford a number of advantages for problems in the rapidly burgeoning area of nanoscale engineering and technology, though they are typically quite complex to implement and limited to single-component fluid systems. We describe an approach for modeling multicomponent hydrodynamic problems spanning multiple length scales when using particle-based descriptions for both the finely resolved (e.g., molecular dynamics) and coarse-grained (e.g., continuum) subregions within an overall simulation domain. This technique is based on the multiscale methodology previously developed for mesoscale binary fluids [N. D. Petsev, L. G. Leal, and M. S. Shell, J. Chem. Phys. 144, 084115 (2016)], simulated using a particle-based continuum method known as smoothed dissipative particle dynamics. An important application of this approach is the ability to perform coupled molecular dynamics (MD) and continuum modeling of molecularly miscible binary mixtures. In order to validate this technique, we investigate multicomponent hybrid MD-continuum simulations at equilibrium, as well as non-equilibrium cases featuring concentration gradients.

"Title: HYDROPHOBE Challenge: A Joint Experimental and Computational Study on the Host–Guest Binding of Hydrocarbons to Cucurbiturils, Allowing Explicit Evaluation of Guest Hydration Free-Energy Contributions
Authors: Khaleel I. Assaf, Mara Florea, Jens Antony, Niel M. Henriksen, Jian Yin, Andreas Hansen, Zheng-wang Qu, Rebecca Sure, Dieter Klapstein, Michael K. Gilson, Stefan Grimme, and Werner M. Nau
Abstract: The host–guest complexation of hydrocarbons (22 guest molecules) with cucurbit[7]uril was investigated in aqueous solution using the indicator displacement strategy. The binding constants (103–109 M–1) increased with guest size, pointing to the hydrophobic effect and dispersion interactions as driving forces. The measured affinities provide unique benchmark data for the binding of neutral guest molecules. Consequently, a computational blind challenge, the HYDROPHOBE challenge, was conducted to allow a comparison with state-of-the-art computational methods for predicting host–guest affinity constants. In total, three quantum-chemical (QM) data sets and two explicit-solvent molecular dynamics (MD) submissions were received. When searching for sources of uncertainty in predicting the host–guest affinities, the experimentally known hydration energies of the investigated hydrocarbons were used to test the employed solvation models (explicit solvent for MD and COSMO-RS for QM). Good correlations were obtained for both solvation models, but a rather constant offset was observed for the COSMO data, by ca. +2 kcal mol–1, which was traced back to a required reference-state correction in the QM submissions (2.38 kcal mol–1). Introduction of the reference-state correction improved the predictive power of the QM methods, particularly for small hydrocarbons up to C5.

J. Chem. Theory Comput., 2018, 14 (2), pp 856–866

Computation of nonlinear optical response functions allows for an in-depth connection between theory and experiment. Experimentally recorded spectra provide a high density of information, but to objectively disentangle overlapping signals and to reach a detailed and reliable understanding of the system dynamics, measurements must be integrated with theoretical approaches. Here, we present a new, highly accurate and efficient trajectory-based semiclassical path integral method for computing higher order nonlinear optical response functions for non-Markovian open quantum systems. The approach is, in principle, applicable to general Hamiltonians and does not require any restrictions on the form of the intrasystem or system–bath couplings. This method is systematically improvable and is shown to be valid in parameter regimes where perturbation theory-based methods qualitatively breakdown. As a test of the methodology presented here, we study a system–bath model for a coupled dimer for which we compare against numerically exact results and standard approximate perturbation theory-based calculations. Additionally, we study a monomer with discrete vibronic states that serves as the starting point for future investigation of vibronic signatures in nonlinear electronic spectroscopy.","Title: Molecular-Scale Description of SPAN80 Desorption from a Squalane–Water Interface
Authors: L. Tan, L. R. Pratt, and M. I. Chaudhari
Abstract: Extensive all-atom molecular dynamics calculations on the water–squalane interface for nine different loadings with sorbitan monooleate (SPAN80), at T = 300 K, are analyzed for the surface tension equation of state, desorption free-energy profiles as they depend on loading, and to evaluate escape times for adsorbed SPAN80 into the bulk phases. These results suggest that loading only weakly affects accommodation of a SPAN80 molecule by this squalane–water interface. Specifically, the surface tension equation of state is simple through the range of high tension to high loading studied, and the desorption free-energy profiles are weakly dependent on loading here. The perpendicular motion of the centroid of the SPAN80 headgroup ring is well-described by a diffusional model near the minimum of the desorption free-energy profile. Lateral diffusional motion is weakly dependent on loading. Escape times evaluated on the basis of a diffusional model and the desorption free energies are 7 × 10–2 s (into the squalane) and 3 × 102 h (into the water). The latter value is consistent with desorption times of related lab-scale experimental work.

Abstract:
Path integral-based methodologies play a crucial role for the investigation of nuclear quantum effects by means of computer simulations. However, these techniques are significantly more demanding than corresponding classical simulations. To reduce this numerical effort, we recently proposed a method, based on a rigorous Hamiltonian formulation, which restricts the quantum modeling to a small but relevant spatial region within a larger reservoir where particles are treated classically. In this work, we extend this idea and show how it can be implemented along with state-of-the-art path integral simulation techniques, including path-integral molecular dynamics, which allows for the calculation of quantum statistical properties, and ring-polymer and centroid molecular dynamics, which allow the calculation of approximate quantum dynamical properties. To this end, we derive a new integration algorithm that also makes use of multiple time-stepping. The scheme is validated via adaptive classical–path-integral simulations of liquid water. Potential applications of the proposed multiresolution method are diverse and include efficient quantum simulations of interfaces as well as complex biomolecular systems such as membranes and proteins.",
"Title: Ionic Solution: What Goes Right and Wrong with Continuum Solvation Modeling
Authors: Changhao Wang, Pengyu Ren, and Ray Luo
Abstract: Solvent-mediated electrostatic interactions were well recognized to be important in the structure and function of molecular systems. Ionic interaction is an important component in electrostatic interactions, especially in highly charged molecules, such as nucleic acids. Here, we focus on the quality of the widely used Poisson–Boltzmann surface area (PBSA) continuum models in modeling ionic interactions by comparing with both explicit solvent simulations and the experiment. In this work, the molality-dependent chemical potentials for sodium chloride (NaCl) electrolyte were first simulated in the SPC/E explicit solvent. Our high-quality simulation agrees well with both the previous study and the experiment. Given the free-energy simulations in SPC/E as the benchmark, we used the same sets of snapshots collected in the SPC/E solvent model for PBSA free-energy calculations in the hope to achieve the maximum consistency between the two solvent models. Our comparative analysis shows that the molality-dependent chemical potentials of NaCl were reproduced well with both linear PB and nonlinear PB methods, although nonlinear PB agrees better with SPC/E and the experiment. Our free-energy simulations also show that the presence of salt increases the hydrophobic effect in a nonlinear fashion, in qualitative agreement with previous theoretical studies of Onsager and Samaras. However, the lack of molality-dependency in the nonelectrostatics continuum models dramatically reduces the overall quality of PBSA methods in modeling salt-dependent energetics. These analyses point to further improvements needed for more robust modeling of solvent-mediated interactions by the continuum solvation frameworks.

Hui-Min Gao,  Hong Liu,  Hu-Jun Qian,  Gui-Sheng Jiao  and  Zhong-Yuan Lu
Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2018,20, 1381-1394 
We have developed a multiscale model that combines first-principles methods with atomistic and mesoscopic simulations to explore the molecular structures and packing density of the ligands present on the gold nanoparticle (AuNP) surface, as well as the adsorption/exchange reaction kinetics of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)/PEG-SH ligands on different facets of gold, namely, Au(111), Au(100), and Au(110). Our model predicts that on clean gold surfaces, CTAB adsorption is diffusion limited. Specifically, CTAB has the preferentially higher adsorption rate and coverage density on Au(100) and Au(110) surfaces, forming a more compact layer with respect to that on the Au(111) surface, which could result in greater growth of gold nanoparticles along the (111) direction. As opposed to CTAB adsorption, the exchange reaction between PEG-SH with CTAB shows no selectivity to different crystal faces, and the reaction process follows Langmuir diffusion kinetics. Kinetic analysis reveals that, in water, the exchange reaction is zeroth order with respect to the concentration of an incoming PEG-SH, indicative of a dissociative exchange mechanism. The observed rate constant decreases exponentially with the PEG-SH chain length, consistent with a diffusion process for the free PEG-SH in water. In particular, we show that the exchange efficiency increases as the chain rigidness and size of the incoming ligand and/or steric bulk of the initial protecting ligand shell are decreased. Our objectives are to provide a model to assess the kinetics and thermodynamics of the adsorption/exchange reaction process, and we expect that these findings will have important implications for routine surface characterization of AuNPs.","Title: Ca2+-Switchable Glucose Dehydrogenase Associated with Electrochemical/Electronic Interfaces: Applications to Signal-Controlled Power Production and Biomolecular Release

Abstract: An artificial Ca2+-regulated PQQ glucose dehydrogenase (PQQ-GDH) enzyme was electrically connected to conducting electrodes and semiconductor interfaces. Direct electron transfer from the enzyme to the conducting electrode support was stimulated by the addition of Ca2+ cations resulting in reversible enzyme activation. A signal-switchable biofuel cell and biomolecular release have been realized using the Ca2+-activated enzyme immobilized on conducting electrodes. Interfacing the signal-switchable enzyme with a semiconductor chip allowed electronic read out of the enzyme ON-OFF states. The developed approach based on the signal-regulated PQQ-GDH enables numerous bioelectrochemical/bioelectronic applications of the developed systems in signal-activated biosensors and biofuel cells, as well as in biomolecular computing/logic systems.

Authors: Yoav Atsmon-Raz and D. Peter Tieleman
Abstract: Peripheral membrane proteins go through various post-translational modifications that covalently bind fatty acid tails to specific amino acids. These post-translational modifications significantly alter the lipophilicity of the modified proteins and allow them to anchor to biological membranes. Over 1000 different proteins have been identified to date that require such membrane–protein interactions to carry out their biological functions, including members of the Src and Ras superfamilies that play key roles in cell signaling and carcinogenesis. We have used all-atom simulations with the CHARMM36 force field to parameterize four of the most common post-translational modifications for the Martini 2.2 force field: palmitoylated cysteine, farnesylated cysteine, geranylgeranylated cysteine, and myristoylated glycine. The parameters reproduce the key features of clusters of configurations of the different anchors in lipid membranes as well as the water–octanol partitioning free energies of the anchors, which are crucial for the correct reproduction of the expected biophysical behavior of peripheral membrane proteins at the membrane–water interface. Implementation in existing Martini setup tools facilitates the use of the new parameters.

Authors: Fatemeh Sadat Alavi, Mansour Zahedi, Nasser Safari, and Ulf Ryde
Abstract: Heme oxygenase is an enzyme that degrades heme, thereby recycling iron in most organisms, including humans. Pervious density functional theory (DFT) calculations have suggested that iron(III) hydroxyheme, an intermediate generated in the first step of heme degradation by heme oxygenase, is converted to iron(III) superoxo oxophlorin in the presence of dioxygen. In this article, we have studied the detailed mechanism of conversion of iron(III) superoxo oxophlorin to verdoheme by using combined quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations. The calculations employed the B3LYP method and the def2-QZVP basis set, considering dispersion effects with the DFT-D3 approach, obtaining accurate energies with large QM regions of almost 1000 atoms. The reaction was found to be exothermic by −35 kcal/mol, with a rate-determining barrier of 19 kcal/mol in the doublet state. The protein environment and especially water in the enzyme pocket significantly affects the reaction by decreasing the reaction activation energies and changing the structures by providing strategic hydrogen bonds.

Abstract:
Simulating nucleation of molecular crystals is extremely challenging for all but the simplest cases. The challenge lies in formulating effective order parameters that are capable of driving the transition process. In recent years, order parameters based on molecular pair-functions have been successfully used in combination with enhanced sampling techniques to simulate nucleation of simple molecular crystals. However, despite the success of these approaches, we demonstrate that they can fail when applied to more complex cases. In fact, we show that order parameters based on molecular pair-functions, while successful at nucleating benzene, fail for paracetamol. Hence, we introduce a novel approach to formulate order parameters. In our approach, we construct reduced dimensional distributions of relevant quantities on the fly and then quantify the difference between these distributions and selected reference distributions. By computing the distribution of different quantities and by choosing different reference distributions, it is possible to systematically construct an effective set of order parameters. We then show that our new order parameters are capable of driving the nucleation of ordered states and, in particular, the Form I crystal of paracetamol.",
"A variational conformational dynamics approach to the selection of collective variables in metadynamics

The Journal of Chemical Physics

Volume 147, 2017, pp 204109 DOI: 10.1063/1.4998598

In  this  paper,  we  combine  two  powerful  computational  techniques,  well-tempered  metadynamics and time-lagged independent component analysis. The aim is to develop a new tool for studying rare events and exploring complex free energy landscapes. Metadynamics is a well-established and widely used enhanced sampling method whose efficiency depends on an appropriate choice of collective variables. Often the initial choice is not optimal leading to slow convergence. However by analyzing the dynamics generated in one such run with a time-lagged independent component analysis and the techniques recently developed in the area of conformational dynamics, we obtain much more efficient collective variables that are also better capable of illuminating the physics of the system. We demonstrate the power of this approach in two paradigmatic examples.
","Multiscale virtual particle based elastic network model (MVP-ENM) for normal mode analysis of large-sized biomolecules
Kelin Xia
Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2018,20, 658-669 
In this paper, a multiscale virtual particle based elastic network model (MVP-ENM) is proposed for the normal mode analysis of large-sized biomolecules. The multiscale virtual particle (MVP) model is proposed for the discretization of biomolecular density data. With this model, large-sized biomolecular structures can be coarse-grained into virtual particles such that a balance between model accuracy and computational cost can be achieved. An elastic network is constructed by assuming “connections” between virtual particles. The connection is described by a special harmonic potential function, which considers the influence from both the mass distributions and distance relations of the virtual particles. Two independent models, i.e., the multiscale virtual particle based Gaussian network model (MVP-GNM) and the multiscale virtual particle based anisotropic network model (MVP-ANM), are proposed. It has been found that in the Debye–Waller factor (B-factor) prediction, the results from our MVP-GNM with a high resolution are as good as the ones from GNM. Even with low resolutions, our MVP-GNM can still capture the global behavior of the B-factor very well with mismatches predominantly from the regions with large B-factor values. Further, it has been demonstrated that the low-frequency eigenmodes from our MVP-ANM are highly consistent with the ones from ANM even with very low resolutions and a coarse grid. Finally, the great advantage of MVP-ANM model for large-sized biomolecules has been demonstrated by using two poliovirus virus structures. The paper ends with a conclusion.","1.

Abstract Determining the stability of molecules and condensed phases is the cornerstone of atomistic modeling, underpinning our understanding of chemical and materials properties and transformations. We show that a machine-learning model, based on a local description of chemical environments and Bayesian statistical learning, provides a unified framework to predict atomic-scale properties. It captures the quantum mechanical effects governing the complex surface reconstructions of silicon, predicts the stability of different classes of molecules with chemical accuracy, and distinguishes active and inactive protein ligands with more than 99% reliability. The universality and the systematic nature of our framework provide new insight into the potential energy surface of materials and molecules.
","Two-step relaxation mode analysis with multiple evolution times applied to all-atom molecular dynamics protein simulation

Phys. Rev. E 96, 062408 – Published 15 December 2017
N. Karasawa, A. Mitsutake, and H. Takano

Proteins implement their functionalities when folded into specific three-dimensional structures, and their functions are related to the protein structures and dynamics. Previously, we applied a relaxation mode analysis (RMA) method to protein systems; this method approximately estimates the slow relaxation modes and times via simulation and enables investigation of the dynamic properties underlying the protein structural fluctuations. Recently, two-step RMA with multiple evolution times has been proposed and applied to a slightly complex homopolymer system, i.e., a single [n] polycatenane. This method can be applied to more complex heteropolymer systems, i.e., protein systems, to estimate the relaxation modes and times more accurately. In two-step RMA, we first perform RMA and obtain rough estimates of the relaxation modes and times. Then, we apply RMA with multiple evolution times to a small number of the slowest relaxation modes obtained in the previous calculation. Herein, we apply this method to the results of principal component analysis (PCA). First, PCA is applied to a 2-μs molecular dynamics simulation of hen egg-white lysozyme in aqueous solution. Then, the two-step RMA method with multiple evolution times is applied to the obtained principal components. The slow relaxation modes and corresponding relaxation times for the principal components are much improved by the second RMA.",

A detailed understanding of the conformational dynamics of biological molecules is difficult to obtain by experimental techniques due to resolution limitations in both time and space. Computer simulations avoid these in theory but are often too short to sample rare events reliably. Here we show that the progress index-guided sampling (PIGS) protocol can be used to enhance the sampling of rare events in selected parts of biomolecules without perturbing the remainder of the system. The method is very easy to use as it only requires as essential input a set of several features representing the parts of interest sufficiently. In this feature space, new states are discovered by spontaneous fluctuations alone and in unsupervised fashion. Because there are no energetic biases acting on phase space variables or projections thereof, the trajectories PIGS generates can be analyzed directly in the framework of transition networks. We demonstrate the possibility and usefulness of such focused explorations of biomolecules with two loops that are part of the binding sites of bromodomains, a family of epigenetic “reader” modules. This real-life application uncovers states that are structurally and kinetically far away from the initial crystallographic structures and are also metastable. Representative conformations are intended to be used in future high-throughput virtual screening campaigns.",,"2.

DOI: arXiv:1712.03863 
Abstract Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation based on Langevin equation has been widely used in the study of structural, thermal properties of matters in difference phases. Normally, the atomic dynamics are described by classical equations of motion and the effect of the environment is taken into account through the fluctuating and frictional forces. Generally, the nuclear quantum effects and their coupling to other degrees of freedom are difficult to include in an efficient way. This could be a serious limitation on its application to the study of dynamical properties of materials made from light elements, in the presence of external driving electrical or thermal fields. One example of such system is single molecular dynamics on metal surface, an important system that has received intense study in surface science. In this review, we summarize recent effort in extending the Langevin MD to include nuclear quantum effect and their coupling to flowing electrical current. We discuss its applications in the study of adsorbate dynamics on metal surface, current-induced dynamics in molecular junctions, and quantum thermal transport between different reservoirs.
","Construction of non-Markovian coarse-grained models employing the Mori–Zwanzig formalism and iterative Boltzmann inversion

Yuta Yoshimoto, Zhen Li, Ikuya Kinefuchi, and George Em Karniadakis

We propose a new coarse-grained (CG) molecular simulation technique based on the Mori–Zwanzig (MZ) formalism along with the iterative Boltzmann inversion (IBI). Non-Markovian dissipative particle dynamics (NMDPD) taking into account memory effects is derived in a pairwise interaction form from the MZ-guided generalized Langevin equation. It is based on the introduction of auxiliary variables that allow for the replacement of a non-Markovian equation with a Markovian one in a higher dimensional space. We demonstrate that the NMDPD model exploiting MZ-guided memory kernels can successfully reproduce the dynamic properties such as the mean square displacement and velocity autocorrelation function of a Lennard–Jones system, as long as the memory kernels are appropriately evaluated based on the Volterra integral equation using the force-velocity and velocity-velocity correlations. Furthermore, we find that the IBI correction of a pair CG potential significantly improves the representation of static properties characterized by a radial distribution function and pressure, while it has little influence on the dynamic processes. Our findings suggest that combining the advantages of both the MZ formalism and IBI leads to an accurate representation of both the static and dynamic properties of microscopic systems that exhibit non-Markovian behavior.",
"Conditional Reversible Work Coarse-Grained Models of Molecular Liquids with Coulomb Electrostatics – A Proof of Concept Study on Weakly Polar Organic Molecules

Deichmann, Gregor and van der Vegt, Nico F. A.

Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation 

Article ASAP, 2017 DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00611

Scale bridging simulations of soft matter rely on the availability of transferable coarse-grained models. In systematic coarse-graining approaches, core principles of statistical mechanics are used to relate the coarse-grained models to the underlying molecular interactions. The conditional reversible work (CRW) method provides effective, nonbonded pair potentials by means of computing coupling free energies between mapped chemical groups. This method has so far been used almost exclusively for systems composed of apolar organic molecules, but additional challenges arise when developing coarse-grained models for polar molecules in which (long-range) electrostatic interactions are important. Herein, we present a modified formulation of the CRW method where we divide the effective interaction potential into van der Waals and electrostatic components. The shape of the effective electrostatic interaction justifies modeling the electrostatics using a Coulomb potential with point charges on each site that are equal to the net charge of the underlying group of atoms. We perform CRW calculations using two polar molecules as test cases (an ether (1,2-dimethoxyethane) and an ester (ethyl propionate)). The results of subsequent liquid state simulations indicate that the coarse-grained models obtained by the new method are of similar quality with respect to representability and thermodynamic transferability as formerly developed models for apolar systems.

Abstract
A new approach for efficiently exploring the configuration space and computing the free energy of large atomic and molecular systems is proposed, motivated by an analogy with reinforcement learning. There are two major components in this new approach. Like metadynamics, it allows for an efficient exploration of the configuration space by adding an adaptively computed biasing potential to the original dynamics. Like deep reinforcement learning, this biasing potential is trained on the fly using deep neural networks, with data collected judiciously from the exploration. Applications to the full-atom, explicit solvent models of alanine dipeptide and tripeptide show some of promise for this new approach","Principal component analysis on a torus: Theory and application to protein dynamics

Adopting a geometrical view of PCA, various distance measures on a torus are introduced and the associated problem of projecting data onto the principal subspaces is discussed. The main idea is that the (periodicity-induced) projection error can be minimized by transforming the data such that the maximal gap of the sampling is shifted to the periodic boundary. In a second step, the covariance matrix and its eigendecomposition can be computed in a standard manner. Adopting molecular dynamics simulations of two well-established biomolecular systems (Aib9 and villin headpiece), the potential of the method to analyze the dynamics of backbone dihedral angles is demonstrated. The new approach allows for a robust and well-defined construction of metastable states and provides low-dimensional reaction coordinates that accurately describe the free energy landscape. Moreover, it offers a direct interpretation of covariances and principal components in terms of the angular variables. Apart from its application to PCA, the method of maximal gap shifting is general and can be applied to any other dimensionality reduction method for circular data.",

Abstract
M2 protein of influenza A virus is a proton channel spanning the viral envelope. This proton channel activity is required for uncoating of viral particles and equilibrating the pH across the trans-Golgi apparatus to prevent a conformational change of hemagglutinin. Amantadine is an anti-influenza A virus drug which inhibits M2 proton channel activity by binding to the channel pore, however, the majority of currently circulating influenza A viruses are amantadine-resistant. The most prevalent resistant mutation is a substitution from Ser31 to Asn31 in M2. To provide new approaches for the design of novel M2 channel blockers, further atomistic analysis of ligand-M2 complexes is needed. Here we examined the free energy profiles of the binding kinetics of M2 channel blockers by well-tempered metadynamics simulations. We found that amantadine first binds to Asp24 of S31 M2 and forms a metastable conformation. In contrast, the free energy profiles of adamantyl bromothiophene dual inhibitor with either S31 M2 or N31 M2 were a broad funnel-shaped curve, suggesting that adamantyl bromothiophene does not form metastable complexes with M2. The trajectory of well-tempered metadynamics simulations revealed that the steric hindrance between adamantyl bromothiophene and S31 M2 interrupts the formation of metastable conformation at Asp24, and a halogen bond between the bromine atom and N31 is responsible for pulling down the ligand to the channel pore of N31 M2 without metastable state. Based on these results, we propose binding pathways of M2 channel blockers to M2 for providing new approaches to design further M2 channel blockers.

Abstract
The t-SNARE complex plays a central role in neuronal fusion. Its components, syntaxin-1 and SNAP25, are largely present in individual clusters and partially colocalize at the presumptive fusion site. How these protein clusters modify local lipid composition and membrane morphology is largely unknown. In this work, using coarse-grained molecular dynamics, the transmembrane domains (TMDs) of t-SNARE complexes are shown to form aggregates leading to formation of lipid nanodomains, which are enriched in cholesterol, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, and gangliosidic lipids. These nano-domains induce membrane curvature that would promote a closer contact between vesicle and plasma membrane.

Abstract
Imaginary-time path-integral (PI) molecular simulations can be used to calculate exact quantum statistical mechanical properties for complex systems containing many interacting atoms and molecules. The limiting computational factor in a PI simulation is typically the evaluation of the potential energy surface (PES) and forces at each ring-polymer “bead”; for an n-bead ring-polymer, a PI simulation is typically n times greater than the corresponding classical simulation. To address the increased computational effort of PI simulations, several approaches have been developed recently, most notably based on the idea of ring-polymer contraction which exploits either the separation of the PES into short-range and long-range contributions or the availability of a computationally inexpensive PES which can be incorporated to effectively smooth the ring-polymer PES; neither approach is satisfactory in applications to systems modeled by PESs given by on-the-fly ab initio calculations. In this article, we describe a new method, ring-polymer interpolation (RPI), which can be used to accelerate PI simulations without any prior assumptions about the PES. In simulations of liquid water modeled by an empirical PES (or force field) under ambient conditions, where quantum effects are known to play a subtle role in influencing experimental observables such as radial distribution functions, we find that RPI can accurately reproduce the results of fully-converged PI simulations, albeit with far fewer PES evaluations. This approach therefore opens the possibility of large-scale PI simulations using ab initio PESs evaluated on-the-fly without the drawbacks of current methods.

Abstract After local transient fluctuations are dissipated, in an energy transfer process, a system evolves to a state where the energy density field varies slowly in time relative to the dynamics of atomic collisions and vibrations. Furthermore, the energy density field remains strongly coupled to the atomic scale processes (collisions and vibrations), and it can serve as the basis of a multiscale theory of energy transfer. Here, a method is introduced to capture the long scale energy density variations as they coevolve with the atomistic state in a way that yields insights into the basic physics and implies an efficient algorithm for energy transfer simulations. The approach is developed based on the N-atom Liouville equation and an interatomic force field, and avoids the need for conjectured phenomenological equations for energy transfer and other processes. The theory is demonstrated for sodium chloride and silicon dioxide nanoparticles immersed in a water bath via molecular dynamics simulations of the energy transfer between a nanoparticle and its aqueous host fluid. The energy density field is computed for different sets of symmetric grid densities, and the multiscale theory holds when slowly varying energy densities at the nodes are obtained. Results strongly depend on grid density and nanoparticle constituent material. A non-uniform temperature distribution, larger thermal fluctuations in the nanoparticle than in the bath and enhancement of fluctuations at the surface, which are expressed due to the atomic nature of the systems, are captured by this method, and not by phenomenological continuum energy transfer models.

Abstract
We perform a series of Monte Carlo simulations on an interface between a liquid crystal (LC) material in isotropic phase in its bulk and a surfactant membrane. These two objects are simulated using coarse-grained molecular models. We estimate physical properties of the membrane such as the interfacial tension and the bending rigidity, focusing on the anchoring effects of the membrane on the LC. According to our simulation results, when the strength of the homeotropic anchoring denoted by the anchoring parameter ξ is increased, the interfacial tension decreases and the bending rigidity first increases in ξ<ξm, and it then decreases in ξm < ξ . We explain these results by constructing a continuum field model based on the two order parameters: directional order of LC and the membrane shape. These order parameters are mutually interacting through the anchoring effect, the fluctuation coupling between the LC and the membrane, and the effect of the nematic layer..

Abstract
Self-diffusion in a two-dimensional simple fluid is investigated by both analytical and numerical means. We investigate the anomalous aspects of self-diffusion in twodimensional fluids with regards to the mean square displacement, the time-dependent diffusion coefficient, and the velocity autocorrelation function using a consistency equation relating these quantities. We numerically confirm the consistency equation by extensive molecular dynamics simulations for finite systems, corroborate earlier results indicating that the kinematic viscosity approaches a finite, non-vanishing value in the thermodynamic limit, and establish the finite size behavior of the diffusion coefficient. We obtain the exact solution of the consistency equation in the thermodynamic limit and use this solution to determine the large time asymptotics of the mean square displacement, the diffusion coefficient, and the velocity autocorrelation function. An asymptotic decay law of the velocity autocorrelation function resembles the previously known self-consistent form, 1/(t √ ln t), however with a rescaled time.

Abstract Often the analysis of time-dependent chemical and biophysical systems produces high-dimensional time-series data for which it can be difficult to interpret which individual features are the most salient. While recent work from our group and others has demonstrated the utility of time-lagged co-variate models to study such systems, linearity assumptions can limit the compression of inherently nonlinear dynamics into just a few characteristic components. Recent work in the field of deep learning has led to the development of variational autoencoders (VAE), which are able to compress complex datasets into simpler manifolds. We present the use of a time-lagged VAE, or variational dynamics encoder (VDE), to reduce complex, nonlinear processes to a single embedding with high fidelity to the underlying dynamics. We demonstrate how the VDE is able to capture nontrivial dynamics in a variety of examples, including Brownian dynamics and atomistic protein folding. Additionally, we demonstrate a method for analyzing the VDE model, inspired by saliency mapping, to determine what features are selected by the VDE model to describe dynamics. The VDE presents an important step in applying techniques from deep learning to more accurately model and interpret complex biophysics.

Abstract Highly ionic environments can mediate unusual chemical reactions that would otherwise be considered impossible based on chemical intuition. For example, the formation of a chemical bond between two iodide anions to form a divalent polyiodide anion is seemingly prohibited due to Coulombic repulsion. Using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, we show that in the 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium (EMIM)/I3 ionic crystal, the reactive formation of divalent and even trivalent polyiodide anions occurs with extremely small energetic barriers, due to the electrostatic ﬁeld of the ionic lattice. A practical consequence of this anomalous reactivity is that iodide anions are eﬃciently transported within the crystal through a “Grotthuss-exchange” mechanism involving bond-breaking and forming events. We characterize two distinct transport pathways, involving both I2− 4 and I3− 7 intermediates, with fast transport of iodide resulting from the release of an I− anion on the opposite side of the intermediate species from the initial bond formation. The ordered cation arrangement in the crystal provides the necessary electrostatic screening for close approach of anions, suggesting a new counter-intuitive approach to obtain high ionic conductivity. This new design principle could be used to develop better solid-state electrolytes for batteries, fuel cells and super-capacitors",,,,
"Efects of Coarse Graining and Saturation of Hydrocarbon Chains on Structure and Dynamics of Simulated Lipid Molecules
Buslaev, P.; Gushchin, I. Scientific Reports, v.7 p.11476 
DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-11761-5
Molecular dynamics simulations are used extensively to study the processes on biological membranes. The simulations can be conducted at diferent levels of resolution: all atom (AA), where all atomistic details are provided; united atom (UA), where hydrogen atoms are treated inseparably of corresponding heavy atoms; and coarse grained (CG), where atoms are grouped into larger particles. Here, we study the behavior of model bilayers consisting of saturated and unsaturated lipids DOPC, SOPC, OSPC and DSPC in simulations performed using all atom CHARMM36 and coarse grained Martini force felds. Using principal components analysis, we show that the structural and dynamical properties of the lipids are similar, both in AA and CG simulations, although the unsaturated molecules are more dynamic and favor more extended conformations. We fnd that CG simulations capture 75 to 100% of the major collective motions, overestimate short range ordering, result in more fexible molecules and 5–7 fold faster sampling. We expect that the results reported here will be useful for comprehensive quantitative comparisons of simulations conducted at diferent resolution levels and for further development and improvement of CG force felds.
","A nucleobase-centered coarse-grained representation for structure prediction of RNA motifs
Simón Poblete, Sandro Bottaro, Giovanni Bussi
https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00741

We introduce the SPlit-and-conQueR (SPQR) model, a coarse-grained representation of RNA designed for structure prediction and refinement. In our approach, the representation of a nucleobase consists of a point particle for the phosphate group and an anisotropic particle for the nucleoside. The interactions are, in principle, knowledge-based potentials inspired by the ESCORE function, a base-centered scoring function. However, a special treatment is given to base-pairing interactions and certain geometrical conformations which are lost in a raw knowledge-base model. This results in a representation able to describe planar canonical and non-canonical base pairs and base-phosphate interactions and to distinguish sugar puckers and glycosidic torsion conformations. The model is applied to the folding of several structures, including duplexes with internal loops of non-canonical base pairs, tetraloops, junctions and a pseudoknot. For the majority of these systems, experimental structures are correctly predicted at the level of individual contacts. We also propose a method for efficiently reintroducing atomistic detail from the coarse-grained representation.","Cholesterol Promotes Protein Binding by Affecting Membrane Electrostatics and Solvation Properties

Binding of the retroviral structural protein Gag to the cellular plasma membrane is mediated by the protein’s matrix (MA) domain. Prominent among MA-PM interactions is electrostatic attraction between the positively charged MA domain and the negatively charged plasma membrane inner leaflet. Previously, we reported that membrane association of HIV-1 Gag, as well as purified Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) MA and Gag, depends strongly on the presence of acidic lipids and is enhanced by cholesterol (Chol). The mechanism underlying this enhancement was unclear. Here, using a broad set of in vitro and in silico techniques we addressed molecular mechanisms of association between RSV MA and model membranes, and investigated how Chol enhances this association. In neutron scattering experiments with liposomes in the presence or absence of Chol, MA preferentially interacted with preexisting POPS-rich clusters formed by nonideal lipid mixing, binding peripherally to the lipid headgroups with minimal perturbation to the bilayer structure. Molecular dynamics simulations showed a stronger MA-bilayer interaction in the presence of Chol, and a large Chol-driven increase in lipid packing and membrane surface charge density. Although in vitro MA-liposome association is influenced by disparate variables, including ionic strength and concentrations of Chol and charged lipids, continuum electrostatic theory revealed an underlying dependence on membrane surface potential. Together, these results conclusively show that Chol affects RSV MA-membrane association by making the electrostatic potential at the membrane surface more negative, while decreasing the penalty for lipid headgroup desolvation. The presented approach can be applied to other viral and nonviral proteins","Implicit Solvation Using the Superposition Approximation (IS-SPA): An Implicit Treatment of the Nonpolar Component to Solvation for Simulating Molecular Aggregation

Nonpolar solute–solvent interactions are the driving force for aggregation in important chemical and biological phenomena including protein folding, peptide self-assembly, and oil–water emulsion formation. Currently, the most accurate and computationally efficient description of these processes requires an explicit treatment of all solvent and solute atoms. Previous computationally feasible implicit solvent models, such as solute surface area approaches, are unsuccessful at capturing aggregation features including both structural and energetic trends while more theoretically rigorous approaches, such as Reference Interaction Site Model (RISM), are accurate but extremely computationally demanding. Our approach, denoted Implicit Solvation using the Superposition Approximation (IS-SPA), builds on previous theory utilizing the Kirkwood superposition approximation to approximate the mean force of the solvent from solute parameters. We introduce and verify a parabolic first solvation shell truncation of atomic solvation, fitting water distributions around a molecule, and a Monte Carlo integration of the mean solvent force. These extensions allow this method to be implemented as an efficient nonpolar implicit solvent model for molecular simulation. The approximations in IS-SPA are first explored and justified for the homodimerization of an array of different sized Lennard-Jones spheres. The accuracy and transferability of the approach are demonstrated by its ability to capture the position and relative energies of the desolvation barrier and free energy minimum of alkane homodimers. The model is then shown to reproduce the phase separation and solubility of cyclohexane and water. These promising results, coupled with 2 orders of magnitude speed-up for dilute systems as compared to explicit solvent simulations, demonstrate that IS-SPA is an appealing approach to boost the time- and length-scale of molecular aggregation simulations.

Khanjari, N.; Eslami, H.; Muller-Plathe, F. J Comp. Chem. v.38, p.2721-2729
DOI: 10.1002/jcc.25066

A metadynamics scheme is presented in which the free energy surface is filled with progressively adding adaptive biasing potentials, obtained from the accumulated probability distribution of the collective variables. Instead of adding Gaussians with assigned height and width in conventional metadynamics method, here we add a more realistic adaptive biasing potential to the Hamiltonian of the system. The shape of the adaptive biasing potential is adjusted on the fly by sampling over the visited states. As the top of the barrier is approached, the biasing potentials become wider. This decreases the problem of trapping the system in the niches, introduced by the addition of Gaussians of fixed height in metadynamics. Our results for the free energy profiles of three test systems show that this method is more accurate and converges more quickly than the conventional metadynamics, and is quite comparable (in accuracy and convergence rate) with the well-tempered metadynamics method

DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b09352
Motor proteins, also known as biological molecular motors, are active enzymatic molecules that support a variety of fundamental biological processes, including cellular transport, cell division, and cell motility. They usually function by transforming chemical energy into mechanical motion, which propels them along linear structures such as protein filaments and nucleic acids. Recent single-molecule experiments measured with high-precision distributions of various dynamic properties of molecular motors. However, it is difficult to utilize these observations to obtain a better description of molecular mechanisms in motor proteins because of the lack of corresponding theoretical methods. To fill this gap, we developed a new theoretical framework to describe the distributions of dynamic properties of biological molecular motors. It is based on the method of first-passage processes. To illustrate our approach, the distributions of run lengths of motor proteins are analyzed. It is found that these distributions depend on the finite length of linear tracks along which the motors move, on the initial position of the motor proteins along the filaments, and on the intermediate chemical transitions during the enzymatic cycle. The physical mechanisms of the observed phenomena are discussed.

","Redefining the Protein−Protein Interface: Coarse Graining and Combinatorics for an Improved Understanding of Amino Acid Contributions to the Protein−Protein Binding Affinity

DOI: 10.1021/acs.langmuir.7b02438

The ability to intervene in biological pathways has for decades been limited by the lack of a quantitative description of protein−protein interactions (PPIs). Herein we generate and compare millions of simple PPI models for insight into the mechanisms of specific recognition and binding. We use a coarse-grained approach whereby amino acids are counted in the interface, and these counts are used as binding affinity predictors. We perform lasso regression, a modern regression technique aimed at interpretability, with every possible amino acid combination (over 106 unique feature sets) to select only those amino acid predictors that provide more information than noise. This approach circumvents arbitrary binning and assumptions about the binding environment that obscure other binding affinity models. Aggregated analysis of these models trained at various interfacial cutoff distances informs the roles of specific amino acids in different binding contexts. We find that a simple amino acid count model outperforms detailed intermolecular contact and binned residue type models. We identify the prevalence of serine, glycine, and tryptophan in the interface as particularly important for predicting binding affinity across a range of distance cutoffs. Although current sample size limitations prevent a robust consensus model for binding affinity prediction, our approach underscores the relevance of a residuebased description of the protein−protein interface to increase our understanding of specific interactions.","How Many Protein Sequences Fold to a Given Structure?

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2017.08.039

Quantifying the relationship between protein sequence and structure is key to understanding the protein universe. A fundamental measure of this relationship is the total number of amino acid sequences that can fold to a target protein structure, known as the “sequence capacity,” which has been suggested as a proxy for how designable a given protein fold is. Although sequence capacity has been extensively studied using lattice models and theory, numerical estimates for real protein structures are currently lacking. In this work, we have quantitatively estimated the sequence capacity of 10 proteins with a variety of different structures using a statistical model based on residue-residue co-evolution to capture the variation of sequences from the same protein family. Remarkably, we find that even for the smallest protein folds, such as the WW domain, the number of foldable sequences is extremely large, exceeding the Avogadro constant. In agreement with earlier theoretical work, the calculated sequence capacity is positively correlated with the size of the protein, or better, the density of contacts. This allows the absolute sequence capacity of a given protein to be approximately predicted from its structure. On the other hand, the relative sequence capacity, i.e., normalized by the total number of possible sequences, is an extremely tiny number and is strongly anti-correlated with the protein length. Thus, although there may be more foldable sequences for larger proteins, it will be much harder to find them. Lastly, we have correlated the evolutionary age of proteins in the CATH database with their sequence capacity as predicted by our model. The results suggest a trade-off between the opposing requirements of high designability and the likelihood of a novel fold emerging by chance.

Lipid droplets (LDs) are ubiquitous, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived organelles that mediate the sequestration of neutral lipids (e.g. triacylglycerol and sterol esters), providing a dynamic cellular storage depot for rapid lipid mobilization in response to increased cellular demands. LDs have a unique ultrastructure, consisting of a core of neutral lipids encircled by a phospholipid monolayer that is decorated with integral and peripheral proteins. The LD proteome contains numerous lipid metabolic enzymes, regulatory scaffold proteins, proteins involved in LD clustering and fusion, and other proteins of unknown functions. The cellular role of LDs is inherently determined by the composition of its proteome and alteration of the LD protein coat provides a powerful mechanism to adapt LDs to fluctuating metabolic states. Here, we review the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern LD protein targeting and degradation.

Interest in fatty acid-derived products as fuel and chemical precursors has grown substantially. Microbes can be genetically engineered to produce fatty acid-derived products that are able to cross host membranes and can be extracted into an applied organic overlay. This process is thought to be passive, with a rate dependent on the chemistry of the crossing compound. The relationship between the chemical composition and the energetics and kinetics of product accumulation within the overlay is not well understood. Through biased and unbiased molecular simulation, we compute the membrane permeability coefficients from production to extraction for different fatty acyl products, including fatty acids, fatty alcohols, fatty aldehydes, alkanes, and alkenes. These simulations identify specific interactions that accelerate the transit of aldehydes across the membrane bilayer relative to other oxidized products, specifically the lack of hydrogen bonds to the surrounding membrane environment. However, since extraction from the outer membrane leaflet into the organic phase is found to be rate limiting for the entire process, we find that fatty alcohols and fatty aldehydes would both manifest similar fluxes into a dodecane overlay under equivalent conditions, outpacing the accumulation of acids or alkanes into the organic phase. Since aldehydes are known to be highly reactive as well as toxic in high quantities, the findings suggest that indeed fatty alcohols are the optimal long-tail fatty acyl product for extraction.

An increasingly important endeavor is to develop computational strategies that enable molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of biomolecular systems with spontaneous changes in protonation states under conditions of constant pH. The present work describes our efforts to implement the powerful constant-pH MD simulation method based on a hybrid nonequilibrium MD/Monte Carlo (neMD/MC) technique within the highly scalable program NAMD. The constant-pH hybrid neMD/MC method has a number of appealing features; it samples the correct semi-grand canonical ensemble rigorously, the computational cost increases linearly with the number of titratable sites, and it is applicable to explicit solvent simulations. The present implementation of the constant-pH hybrid neMD/MC in NAMD is designed to handle a wide range of biomolecular systems with no constraints on the choice of force field. Furthermore, the sampling efficiency can be adaptively improved on-the-fly by adjusting algorithmic parameters during the simulation. Illustrative examples emphasizing medium and large scale applications on next-generation supercomputing architectures are provided

Cytokinesis in most eukaryotic cells is orchestrated by a contractile actomyosin ring. While many of the proteins involved are known, the mechanism of constriction remains unclear. Informed by existing literature and new 3D molecular details from electron cryotomography, here we develop 3D coarse-grained models of actin filaments, unipolar and bipolar myosins, actin crosslinkers, and membranes and simulate their interactions. Exploring a matrix of possible actomyosin configurations suggested that node-based architectures like those presently described for ring assembly result in membrane puckers not seen in EM images of real cells. Instead, the model that best matches data from fluorescence microscopy, electron cryotomography, and biochemical experiments is one in which actin filaments transmit force to the membrane through evenly-distributed, membrane-attached, unipolar myosins, with bipolar myosins in the ring driving contraction. While at this point this model is only favored (not proven), the work highlights the power of coarse-grained biophysical simulations to compare complex mechanistic hypotheses.

Controlling the self-assembly of supramolecular structures is vital for living cells, and a central challenge for engineering at the nano- and microscales. Nevertheless, even particles without optimized shapes can robustly form well-defined morphologies. This is the case in numerous medical conditions where normally soluble proteins aggregate into fibers. Beyond the diversity of molecular mechanisms involved, we propose that fibers generically arise from the aggregation of irregular particles with short-range interactions. Using a minimal model of ill-fitting, sticky particles, we demonstrate robust fiber formation for a variety of particle shapes and aggregation conditions. Geometrical frustration plays a crucial role in this process, and accounts for the range of parameters in which fibers form as well as for their metastable character.","Strongly Correlated Rafts in Both Leaves of an Asymmetric Bilayer

I consider a model of a bilayer characterized by two order parameters, one in each leaf. That of the inner leaf represents the difference in mole fractions of lipids with large spontaneous curvature, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and those with small spontaneous curvatures, phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylserine (PS). Similarly, the order parameter in the outer leaf represents the diff erence in mole fractions of lipids with small spontaneous curvature, PC, and large curvature, sphingomyelin (SM). Each order parameter is coupled to the variations in the height of the membrane that is assumed to be of constant thickness. The couplings are of different strength. I show that, with reasonable parameters, a microemulsion is formed in each leaf, and that the two microemulsions are strongly coupled. Their characteristic size of domains is found to be on the order of 75 nm. In this picture, rafts consist of regions of SM in the outer leaf and PC and PS in the inner leaf, fl oating in a sea of PC in the outer leaf and PE in the inner leaf.

Membrane lipid composition varies greatly within submembrane compartments, different organelle membranes, and also between cells of different cell stage, cell and tissue types, and organisms. Environmental factors (such as diet) also influence membrane composition. The membrane lipid composition is tightly regulated by the cell, maintaining a homeostasis that, if disrupted, can impair cell function and lead to disease. This is especially pronounced in the brain, where defects in lipid regulation are linked to various neurological diseases. The tightly regulated diversity raises questions on how complex changes in composition affect overall bilayer properties, dynamics, and lipid organization of cellular membranes. Here, we utilize recent advances in computational power and molecular dynamics force fields to develop and test a realistically complex human brain plasma membrane (PM) lipid model and extend previous work on an idealized, “average” mammalian PM. The PMs showed both striking similarities, despite significantly different lipid composition, and interesting differences. The main differences in composition (higher cholesterol concentration and increased tail unsaturation in brain PM) appear to have opposite, yet complementary, influences on many bilayer properties. Both mixtures exhibit a range of dynamic lipid lateral inhomogeneities (“domains”). The domains can be small and transient or larger and more persistent and can correlate between the leaflets depending on lipid mixture, Brain or Average, as well as on the extent of bilayer undulations.",

Recruitment dynamics of ESCRT-III and Vps4 to endosomes and implications for reverse membrane budding. Elife. 6: e31652.

The ESCRT machinery mediates reverse membrane scission. By quantitative fluorescence lattice light-sheet microscopy, we have shown that ESCRT-III subunits polymerize rapidly on yeast endosomes, together with the recruitment of at least two Vps4 hexamers. During their 3-45 second lifetimes, the ESCRT-III assemblies accumulated 75-200 Snf7 and 15-50 Vps24 molecules. Productive budding events required at least two additional Vps4 hexamers. Membrane budding was associated with continuous, stochastic exchange of Vps4 and ESCRT-III components, rather than steady growth of fixed assemblies, and depended on Vps4 ATPase activity. An all-or-none step led to final release of ESCRT-III and Vps4. Tomographic electron microscopy demonstrated that acute disruption of Vps4 recruitment stalled membrane budding. We propose a model in which multiple Vps4 hexamers (four or more) draw together several ESCRT-III filaments. This process induces cargo crowding and inward membrane buckling, followed by constriction of the nascent bud neck and ultimately ILV generation by vesicle fission.","""Structural insight into TPX2-stimulated microtubule assembly"", Zhang et al, eLife (2017).

https://elifesciences.org/articles/30959

During mitosis and meiosis, microtubule (MT) assembly is locally upregulated by the chromatin-dependent Ran-GTP pathway. One of its key targets is the MT-associated spindle assembly factor TPX2. The molecular mechanism of how TPX2 stimulates MT assembly remains unknown because structural information about the interaction of TPX2 with MTs is lacking. Here, we determine the cryo-electron microscopy structure of a central region of TPX2 bound to the MT surface. TPX2 uses two flexibly linked elements (’ridge’ and ‘wedge’) in a novel interaction mode to simultaneously bind across longitudinal and lateral tubulin interfaces. These MT-interacting elements overlap with the binding site of importins on TPX2. Fluorescence microscopy-based in vitro reconstitution assays reveal that this interaction mode is critical for MT binding and facilitates MT nucleation. Together, our results suggest a molecular mechanism of how the Ran-GTP gradient can regulate TPX2-dependent MT formation.
","mDia1 senses both force and torque during F-actin filament polymerization

Nature Communications 8, 1650 (2017) doi:10.1038/s41467-017-01745-4
Formins, an important family of force-bearing actin-polymerizing factors, function as homodimers that bind with the barbed end of actin filaments through a ring-like structure assembled from dimerized FH2 domains. It has been hypothesized that force applied to formin may facilitate transition of the FH2 ring from an inhibitory closed conformation to a permissive open conformation, speeding up actin polymerization. We confirm this hypothesis for mDia1 dependent actin polymerization by stretching a single-actin filament in the absence of profilin using magnetic tweezers, and observe that increasing force from 0.5 to 10 pN can drastically speed up the actin polymerization rate. Further, we find that this force-promoted actin polymerization requires torsionally unconstrained actin filament, suggesting that mDia1 also senses torque. As actin filaments are subject to complex mechanical constraints in living cells, these results provide important insights into how formin senses these mechanical constraints and regulates actin organization accordingly.

Binding kinetics and substrate selectivity in HIV-1 protease−Gag interactions probed at atomic resolution by chemical exchange NMR. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. : 1716098114.

The conversion of immature noninfectious HIV-1 particles to infectious virions is dependent upon the sequential cleavage of the precursor group-specific antigen (Gag) polyprotein by HIV-1 pro- tease. The precise mechanism whereby protease recognizes distinct Gag cleavage sites, located in the intrinsically disordered linkers connecting the globular domains of Gag, remains unclear. Here, we probe the dynamics of the interaction of large fragments of Gag and various variants of protease (including a drug resistant construct) using Carr−Purcell−Meiboom−Gill relaxation dispersion and chemical exchange saturation transfer NMR experiments. We show that the conformational dynamics within the flaps of HIV-1 protease that form the lid over the catalytic cleft play a signifi- cant role in substrate specificity and ordered Gag processing. Rapid interconversion between closed and open protease flap con- formations facilitates the formation of a transient, sparsely popu- lated productive complex between protease and Gag substrates. Flap closure traps the Gag cleavage sites within the catalytic cleft of protease. Modulation of flap opening through protease−Gag interactions fine-tunes the lifetime of the productive complex and hence the likelihood of Gag proteolysis. A productive complex can also be formed in the presence of a noncognate substrate but is short-lived owing to lack of optimal complementarity between the active site cleft of protease and the substrate, resulting in rapid flap opening and substrate release, thereby allowing protease to differentiate between cognate and noncognate substrates.","""Solution Structure and Membrane Interaction of the Cytoplasmic Tail of HIV-1 gp41 Protein"", Murphy, Samal, Viach, and Saad.

The cytoplasmic tail of gp41 (gp41CT) remains the last HIV-1 domain with an unknown structure. It plays important roles in HIV-1 replication such as mediating envelope (Env) intracellular trafficking and incorporation into assembling virions, mechanisms of which are poorly understood. Here, we present the solution structure of gp41CT in a micellar environment and characterize its interaction with the membrane. We show that the N-terminal 45 residues are unstructured and not associated with the membrane. However, the C terminal 105 residues form three membrane-bound amphipathic α helices with distinctive structural features such as variable degree of membrane penetration, hydrophobic and basic surfaces, clusters of aromatic residues, and a network of cation-π interactions. This work fills a major gap by providing the structure of the last segment of HIV-1 Env, which will provide insights into the mechanisms of Gag-mediated Env incorporation as well as the overall Env mobility and conformation on the virion surface.

Simulating the nature of voltage activated systems is a problem of major current interest, covering the action of voltage gated ion channels to energy storage batteries. However, fully microscopic converging molecular simulations of external voltage effects present a major challenge and macroscopic models are associated with major uncertainties about the dielectric treatment and the underlying physical basis. Recently we developed a coarse grained (CG) model that represents explicit the electrodes, the electrolytes and the membrane / protein system. The CG model provides a semi-macroscopic way for capturing the microscopic physics of voltage activated systems. Our method was originally validated by reproducing macroscopic and analytical results for key test cases and then used in modeling voltage activated ion channels and related problems. In this work, we further establish the reliability of the CG voltage model by comparing it to the results of Monte Carlo (MC) simulations with a microscopic electrolyte model. The comparison explores different aspects of membrane, electrolytes, electrodes systems ranging from the Gouy-Chapman model to the determination of the electrolyte charge distribution in the solution between two electrodes (without and with separating membrane), as well as the evaluation of gating charges. Overall the agreement is very impressive. This provides a confidence in the CG model and, also shows that the MC model can be used in realistic simulation of voltage activation of proteins with a sufficient computer time.

The structure and dynamics of water at gold surfaces are important for a variety of applications, including lab on a chip and electrowetting. Classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are frequently used to investigate systems with water–gold interfaces, such as biomacromolecules in gold nanoparticle dispersions, but the accuracy of the simulations depends on the suitability of the force field. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of a water molecule on gold were used as a benchmark to assess force field accuracy. It was found that Lennard-Jones potentials did not reproduce the DFT water–gold configurational energy landscape, whereas the softer Morse and Buckingham potentials allowed for a more accurate representation. MD simulations with different force fields exhibited rather different structural and dynamic properties of water on a gold surface. This emphasizes the need for experimental data and further effort on the validation of a realistic force field for water–gold interactions.","Particle-based membrane model for mesoscopic simulation of cellular dynamics

arXiv:1710.06907v1 [physics.bio-ph]
We present a simple and computationally efficient coarse-grained and solvent-free model for simulating lipid bilayer membranes. In order to be used in concert with particle-based reaction-diffusion simulations, the model is purely based on interacting and reacting particles, each representing a coarse patch of a lipid monolayer. Particle interactions include nearest-neighbor bond-stretching and angle-bending, and are parameterized so as to reproduce the local membrane mechanics given by the Helfrich energy density over a range of relevant curvatures. In-plane fluidity is implemented with Monte Carlo bond-flipping moves. The physical accuracy of the model is verified by four tests: (i) Power spectrum analysis of equilibrium thermal undulations is used to verify that the particle-based representation correctly captures the dynamics predicted by the continuum model of fluid membranes. (ii) It is verified that the input bending stiffness, against which the potential parameters are optimized, is accurately recovered. (iii) Simulation of two-dimensional shear flow under a gravity force is employed to measure the effective in-plane viscosity of the membrane model, and show the possibility of modeling membranes with specified viscosities. (iv) Interaction of the bilayer membrane with a spherical nanoparticle is modeled as a test case for large membrane deformations and budding involved in cellular processes such as endocytosis. The results are shown to coincide well with the predicted behavior of continuum models, and the membrane model successfully mimics the expected budding behavior. We expect our model to be of high practical usability for ultra coarse-grained molecular dynamics or particle-based reaction-diffusion simulations of biological systems.","""Active Brownian equation of state: metastability and phase coexistence"", Levis, Codina, and Pagonabarraga.

As a result of the competition between self-propulsion and excluded volume interactions, purely repulsive self-propelled spherical particles undergo a motility-induced phase separation (MIPS). We carry out a systematic computational study, considering several interaction potentials, systems confined by hard walls or with periodic boundary conditions, and different initial conditions. This approach allows us to identify that, despite its non-equilibrium nature, the equations of state of Active Brownian Particles (ABP) across MIPS verify the characteristic properties of first-order liquid–gas phase transitions, meaning, equality of pressure of the coexisting phases once a nucleation barrier has been overcome and, in the opposite case, hysteresis around the transition as long as the system remains in the metastable region. Our results show that the equations of state of ABPs account for their phase behaviour, providing a firm basis to describe MIPS as an equilibrium-like phase transition.

The expansion of computational power, better parameterization of force fields, and the development of novel algorithms to enhance the sampling of the free energy landscapes of proteins have allowed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to become an indispensable tool to understand the function of biomolecules. The temporal and spatial resolution of MD simulations allows for the study of a vast number of processes of interest. Here, we review the computational efforts to uncover the conformational free energy landscapes of a subset of membrane proteins: ion channels, transporters and G-protein coupled receptors. We focus on the various enhanced sampling techniques used to study these questions, how the conclusions come together to build a coherent picture, and the relationship between simulation outcomes and experimental observables.",

The polymer poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) is studied using a novel combination of multiscale modeling methodologies. We develop an iterative Boltzmann inversion potential of concentrated PNIPAM solutions and combine it with lattice Boltzmann as a Navier–Stokes equation solver for the solvent. We study in detail the influence of the methodology on statics and dynamics of the system. The combination is successful and significantly simpler and faster than other mapping techniques for polymer solution while keeping the correct hydrodynamics. The model can semiquantitatively describe the correct phase behavior and polymer dynamics.","Strong attractions and repulsions mediated by monovalent salts

Controlling interactions between proteins and nanoparticles in electrolyte solutions is crucial for advancing biological sciences and biotechnology. The assembly of charged nanoparticles (NPs) and proteins in aqueous solutions can be directed by modifying the salt concentration. High concentrations of monovalent salt can induce the solubilization or crystallization of NPs and proteins. By using a multiscale coarse-grained molecular dynamics approach, we show that, due to ionic correlations in the electrolyte, NPs pairs at high monovalent salt concentrations interact via remarkably strong long-range attractions or repulsions, which can be split into three regimes depending on the surface charge densities of the NPs. NPs with zero-to-low surface charge densities interact via a long-range attraction that is stronger and has a similar range to the depletion attraction induced by polymers with radius of gyrations comparable to the NP diameter. On the other hand, moderately charged NPs with smooth surfaces as well as DNA-functionalized NPs with no possibility of hybridization between them interact via a strong repulsion of range and strength larger than the repulsion predicted by models that neglect ionic correlations, including the Derjaguin–Landau–Vervey–Overbeek (DLVO) model. Interactions between strongly charged NPs (>2 e/nm2), both types smooth and DNA-functionalized NPs, show an attractive potential well at intermediate-to-high salt concentrations, which demonstrates that electrolytes can induce aggregation of strongly charged NPs. Our work provides an improved understanding of the role of ionic correlations in NP assembly and design rules to utilize the salting-out process to crystallize NPs.

Proteins often undergo slow structural rearrangements that involve several angstroms and surpass the nanosecond timescale. These spatiotemporal scales challenge physics-based simulations and open the way to sample-based models of structural dynamics. This article improves an understanding of current capabilities and limitations of sample-based models of dynamics. Borrowing from widely used concepts in evolutionary computation, this article introduces two conflicting aspects of sampling capability and quantifies them via statistical (and graphical) analysis tools. This allows not only conducting a principled comparison of different sample-based algorithms but also understanding which algorithmic ingredients to use as knobs via which to control sampling and, in turn, the accuracy and detail of modeled structural rearrangements. We demonstrate the latter by proposing two powerful variants of a recently published sample-based algorithm. We believe that this work will advance the adoption of sample-based models as reliable tools for modeling slow protein structural rearrangements.",

Binding of the retroviral structural protein Gag to the cellular plasma membrane is mediated by the protein’s matrix (MA) domain. Prominent among MA-PM interactions is electrostatic attraction between the positively charged MA domain and the negatively charged plasma membrane inner leaflet. Previously, we reported that membrane association of HIV-1 Gag, as well as purified Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) MA and Gag, depends strongly on the presence of acidic lipids and is enhanced by cholesterol (Chol). The mechanism underlying this enhancement was unclear. Here, using a broad set of in vitro and in silico techniques we addressed molecular mechanisms of association between RSV MA and model membranes, and investigated how Chol enhances this association. In neutron scattering experiments with liposomes in the presence or absence of Chol, MA preferentially interacted with preexisting POPS-rich clusters formed by nonideal lipid mixing, binding peripherally to the lipid headgroups with minimal perturbation to the bilayer structure. Molecular dynamics simulations showed a stronger MA-bilayer interaction in the presence of Chol, and a large Chol-driven increase in lipid packing and membrane surface charge density. Although in vitro MA-liposome association is influenced by disparate variables, including ionic strength and concentrations of Chol and charged lipids, continuum electrostatic theory revealed an underlying dependence on membrane surface potential. Together, these results conclusively show that Chol affects RSV MA-membrane association by making the electrostatic potential at the membrane surface more negative, while decreasing the penalty for lipid headgroup desolvation. The presented approach can be applied to other viral and nonviral proteins","Self-assembly of model proteins into virus capsids

We consider self-assembly of proteins into a virus capsid by the methods of molecular dynamics. The capsid corresponds either to SPMV or CCMV and is studied with and without the RNA molecule inside. The proteins are flexible and described by the structure-based coarse-grained model augmented by electrostatic interactions. Previous studies of the capsid self-assembly involved solid objects of a supramolecular scale, e.g. corresponding to capsomeres, with engineered couplings and stochastic movements. In our approach, a single capsid is dissociated by an application of a high temperature for a variable period and then the system is cooled down to allow for self-assembly. The restoration of the capsid proceeds to various extent, depending on the nature of the dissociated state, but is rarely complete because some proteins depart too far unless the process takes place in a confined space.","(1)  Huang, C.-Y.; Huang, A.

Proton pumping A-type cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) terminates the respiratory chains of mitochondria and many bacteria. Three possible proton transfer pathways (D, K, and H channels) have been identified based on structural, functional, and mutational data. Whereas the D channel provides the route for all pumped protons in bacterial A-type CcOs, studies of bovine mitochondrial CcO have led to suggestions that its H channel instead provides this route. Here, we have studied H-channel function by performing atomistic molecular dynamics simulations on the entire, as well as core, structure of bovine CcO in a lipid-solvent environment. The majority of residues in the H channel do not undergo large conformational fluctuations. Its upper and middle regions have adequate hydration and H-bonding residues to form potential proton-conducting channels, and Asp51 exhibits conformational fluctuations that have been observed crystallographically. In contrast, throughout the simulations, we do not observe transient water networks that could support proton transfer from the N phase toward heme a via neutral His413, regardless of a labile H bond between Ser382 and the hydroxyethylfarnesyl group of heme a. In fact, the region around His413 only became sufficiently hydrated when His413 was fixed in its protonated imidazolium state, but its calculated pKa is too low for this to provide the means to create a proton transfer pathway. Our simulations show that the electric dipole moment of residues around heme a changes with the redox state, hence suggesting that the H channel could play a more general role as a dielectric well.",

Authors: Margus Rätsep, Kõu Timpmann, Tomoaki Kawakami, Zheng-Yu Wang-Otomo, and Arvi Freiberg
Abstract: The LH1-RC core complex from the thermophilic photosynthetic purple sulfur bacterium Thermochromatium tepidum has recently attracted interest of many researchers because of its several unique properties, such as increased robustness against environmental hardships and the much red-shifted near-infrared absorption spectrum of the LH1 antenna exciton polarons. The known near-atomic-resolution crystal structure of the complex well supported this attention. Yet several mechanistic aspects of the complex prominence remained to be understood. In this work, samples of the native, Ca2+-containing core complexes were investigated along with those destabilized by Ba2+ substitution, using various spectrally selective steady-state and picosecond time-resolved spectroscopic techniques at physiological and cryogenic temperatures. As a result, the current interpretation of exciton spectra of the complex was significantly clarified. Specifically, by evaluating the homogeneous and inhomogeneous compositions of the spectra, we showed that there is little to no effect of cation substitution on the dynamic or kinetic properties of antenna excitons. Reasons of the extra red shift of absorption/fluorescence spectra observed in the Ca-LH1-RC and not in the Ba-LH1-RC complex should thus be searched in subtle structural differences following the inclusion of different cations into the core complex scaffold.","Neural network based prediction of conformational free energies - a new route towards coarse-grained simulation models
Tobias Lemke and Christine Peter
J. Chem. Theory Comput., Just Accepted Manuscript

Abstract:
Coarse-grained (CG) simulation models have become very popular tools to study complex molecular systems with great computational efficiency on length and timescales that are inaccessible to simulations at atomistic resolution. In so-called bottom up coarse-graining strategies, the interactions in the CG model are devised such that an accurate representation of an atomistic sampling of configurational phase space is achieved. This means the coarse-graining methods use the underlying multibody potential of mean force (i.e. free-energy surface) derived from the atomistic simulation as parametrization target. Here, we present a new method where a neural network (NN) is used to extract high-dimensional free energy surfaces (FES) from molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories. These FES are used for simulations on a CG level of resolution. The method is applied to simulating homo-oligo-peptides (oligo-glutamic-acid (oligo-glu) and oligo-aspartic-acid(oligo-asp)) of different lengths. We show that the NN is not only able to correctly describe the free-energy surface for oligomer lengths that it was trained on, but is also able to predict the conformational sampling of longer chains.","(1)  Tamura, N.; Nishimura, T.; Sakamaki, Y.; Koyama-Honda, I.; Yamamoto, H.; Mizushima, N.

Abstract:The bottom-up prediction of the properties of polymeric materials based on molecular dynamics simulation is a major challenge in soft matter physics. Coarse-grained (CG) models are often employed to access greater spatiotemporal scales required for many applications, but these models normally experience significantly altered thermodynamics and highly accelerated dynamics due to the reduced number of degrees of freedom upon coarse-graining. While CG models can be calibrated to meet certain properties at particular state points, there is unfortunately no temperature transferable and chemically specific coarse-graining method that allows for modeling of polymer dynamics over a wide temperature range. Here, we pragmatically address this problem by “correcting” for deviations in activation free energies that occur upon coarse-graining the dynamics of a model polymeric material (polystyrene). In particular, we propose a new strategy based on concepts drawn from the Adam–Gibbs (AG) theory of glass formation. Namely we renormalize the cohesive interaction strength and effective interaction length-scale parameters to modify the activation free energy. We show that this energy-renormalization method for CG modeling allows accurate prediction of atomistic dynamics over the Arrhenius regime, the non-Arrhenius regime of glass formation, and even the non-equilibrium glassy regime, thus allowing for the predictive modeling of dynamic properties of polymer over the entire range of glass formation. Our work provides a practical scheme for establishing temperature transferable coarse-grained models for predicting and designing the properties of polymeric materials.",
"Freezing Temperatures, Ice Nanotubes Structures, and Proton Ordering of TIP4P/ICE Water inside Single Wall Carbon Nanotubes
P. Pugliese, M. M. Conde, M. Rovere, and P. Gallo
A very recent experimental paper importantly and unexpectedly showed that water in carbon nanotubes is already in the solid ordered phase at the temperature where bulk water boils. The water models used so far in literature for molecular dynamics simulations in carbon nanotubes show freezing temperatures lower than the experiments. We present here results from molecular dynamics simulations of water inside single walled carbon nanotubes using an extremely realistic model for both liquid and icy water, the TIP4P/ICE. The water behavior inside nanotubes of different diameters has been studied upon cooling along the isobars at ambient pressure starting from temperatures where water is in a liquid state. We studied the liquid/solid transition, and we observed freezing temperatures higher than in bulk water and that depend on the diameter of the nanotube. The maximum freezing temperature found is 390 K, which is in remarkable agreement with the recent experimental measurements. We have also analyzed the ice structure called “ice nanotube” that water forms inside the single walled carbon nanotubes when it freezes. The ice forms observed are in agreement with previous results obtained with different water models. A novel finding, a partial proton ordering, is evidenced in our ice nanotubes at finite temperature.","Harmonic-phase path-integral approximation of thermal quantum correlation functions Scilight relation icon

Abstract:We present an approximation to the thermal symmetric form of the quantum time-correlation function in the standard position path-integral representation. By transforming to a sum-and-difference position representation and then Taylor-expanding the potential energy surface of the system to second order, the resulting expression provides a harmonic weighting function that approximately recovers the contribution of the phase to the time-correlation function. This method is readily implemented in a Monte Carlo sampling scheme and provides exact results for harmonic potentials (for both linear and non-linear operators) and near-quantitative results for anharmonic systems for low temperatures and times that are likely to be relevant to condensed phase experiments. This article focuses on one-dimensional examples to provide insights into convergence and sampling properties, and we also discuss how this approximation method may be extended to many-dimensional systems.

"Absence of Intramolecular Singlet Fission in Pentacene–Perylenediimide Heterodimers: The Role of Charge Transfer State
Long Wang, Yishi Wu, Jianwei Chen, Lanfen Wang, Yanping Liu, Zhenyi Yu, Jiannian Yao, and Hongbing Fu
A new class of donor–acceptor heterodimers based on two singlet fission (SF)-active chromophores, i.e., pentacene (Pc) and perylenediimide (PDI), was developed to investigate the role of charge transfer (CT) state on the excitonic dynamics. The CT state is efficiently generated upon photoexcitation. However, the resulting CT state decays to different energy states depending on the energy levels of the CT state. It undergoes extremely rapid deactivation to the ground state in polar CH2Cl2, whereas it undergoes transformation to a Pc triplet in nonpolar toluene. The efficient triplet generation in toluene is not due to SF but CT-mediated intersystem crossing. In light of the energy landscape, it is suggested that the deep energy level of the CT state relative to that of the triplet pair state makes the CT state actually serve as a trap state that cannot undergoes an intramolecular singlet fission process. These results provide guidance for the design of SF materials and highlight the requisite for more widely applicable design principles.","Time-lagged autoencoders: Deep learning of slow collective variables for molecular kinetics

Abstract:Inspired by the success of deep learning techniques in the physical and chemical sciences, we apply a modification of an autoencoder type deep neural network to the task of dimension reduction of molecular dynamics data. We can show that our time-lagged autoencoder reliably finds low-dimensional embeddings for high-dimensional feature spaces which capture the slow dynamics of the underlying stochastic processes - beyond the capabilities of linear dimension reduction techniques.","On the Density Dependence of the Integral Equation Coarse-Graining Effective Potential

Coarse-graining (CG) procedures provide computationally efficient methods for investigating the corresponding long time- and length-scale processes. In the bottom-up approaches, the effective interactions between the CG sites is obtained using the information from the atomistic simulations, but reliable CG procedures are required to preserve the structure and thermodynamics. In this regard, the integral equation coarse-graining (IECG) method is a promising approach that uses the first-principles Ornstein-Zernike equation in liquid state theory to determine the effective potential between CG sites. In this work, we present the details of the IECG method while treating the density as an intrinsic property and active variable of the CG system. Performing extensive simulations of polymer melts, we show that the IECG theory/simulation and atomistic simulation results are consistent in structural properties such as the pair-correlation functions and form factors, and also thermodynamic properties such as pressure. The atomistic simulations of the liquids show that the structure is largely sensitive to the repulsive part of the potential. Similarly, the IECG simulations of polymeric liquids show that the structure can be determined by the relatively short-range CG repulsive interactions, but the pressure is only accurately determined once the long-range, weak CG attractive interactions are included. This is in agreement with the seminal work by Widom on the influence of the potential on the phase diagram of the liquid [Science 157, 375 (1967)]. Other aspects of the IECG theory/simulations are also discussed.


","Statistical mechanics of transport processes in active fluids: Equations of hydrodynamics Katherine Klymko, Dibyendu Mandal, and Kranthi K. Mandadapu, Journal of Chemical Physics 147, 194109 (2017);

Abstract:
The equations of hydrodynamics including mass, linear momentum, angular momentum, and energy are derived by coarse-graining the microscopic equations of motion for systems consisting of rotary dumbbells driven by internal torques. In deriving the balance of linear momentum, we find that the symmetry of the stress tensor is broken due to the presence of non-zero torques on individual particles. The broken symmetry of the stress tensor induces internal spin in the fluid and leads us to consider the balance of internal angular momentum in addition to the usual moment of momentum. In the absence of spin, the moment of momentum is the same as the total angular momentum. In deriving the form of the balance of total angular momentum, we find the microscopic expressions for the couple stress tensor that drives the spin field. We show that the couple stress contains contributions from both intermolecular interactions and the active forces. The presence of spin leads to the idea of balance of moment of inertia due to the constant exchange of particles in a small neighborhood around a macroscopic point. We derive the associated balance of moment of inertia at the macroscale and identify the moment of inertia flux that induces its transport. Finally, we obtain the balances of total and internal energy of the active fluid and identify the sources of heat and heat fluxes in the system",
"Scaffolding the cup-shaped double membrane in autophagy
Amir Houshang Bahrami, Mary G. Lin, Xuefeng Ren, James H. Hurley, Gerhard Hummer
PLoS Comput Biol 13(10): e1005817
Autophagy is a physiological process for the recycling and degradation of cellular materials. Forming the autophagosome from the phagophore, a cup-shaped double-membrane vesi- cle, is a critical step in autophagy. The origin of the cup shape of the phagophore is poorly understood. In yeast, fusion of a small number of Atg9-containing vesicles is considered a key step in autophagosome biogenesis, aided by Atg1 complexes (ULK1 in mammals) local- ized at the preautophagosomal structure (PAS). In particular, the S-shaped Atg17-Atg31- Atg29 subcomplex of Atg1 is critical for phagophore nucleation at the PAS. To study this process, we simulated membrane remodeling processes in the presence and absence of membrane associated Atg17. We show that at least three vesicles need to fuse to induce the phagophore shape, consistent with experimental observations. However, fusion alone is not sufficient. Interactions with 34-nm long, S-shaped Atg17 complexes are required to over- come a substantial kinetic barrier in the transition to the cup-shaped phagophore. Our find- ing rationalizes the recruitment of Atg17 complexes to the yeast PAS, and their unusual shape. In control simulations without Atg17, with weakly binding Atg17, or with straight instead of S-shaped Atg17, the membrane shape transition did not occur. We confirm the critical role of Atg17-membrane interactions experimentally by showing that mutations of putative membrane interaction sites result in reduction or loss of autophagic activity in yeast. Fusion of a small number of vesicles followed by Atg17-guided membrane shape- remodeling thus emerges as a viable route to phagophore formation.

ABSTRACT: A general method for parameterizing atomic interaction functions is presented. The method is based on an analysis of surfaces corresponding to the difference between calculated and target data as a function of alternative combinations of parameters (parameter space mapping). The consideration of surfaces in parameter space as opposed to local values or gradients leads to a better understanding of the relationships between the parameters being optimized and a given set of target data. This in turn enables for a range of target data from multiple molecules to be combined in a robust manner, and for the optimal region of parameter space to be trivially identified. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated by using the method to refine the chlorine 6-12 Lennard-Jones parameters against experimental solvation free enthalpies in water and hexane as well as the density and heat of vaporization of the liquid at atmospheric pressure for a set of 10 aromatic-chloro compounds simultaneously. Single-step perturbation is used to efficiently calculate solvation free energies for a wide range of parameter combinations. The capacity of this approach to parameterize accurate and transferrable force fields is discussed.
","Path-integral simulation of graphene monolayers under tensile stress
Carlos P. Herrero and  Rafael Ramírez

Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2017,19, 31898-31909 

Finite-temperature properties of graphene monolayers under tensile stress have been studied by path-integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations. This method allows one to consider the quantization of vibrational modes in these crystalline membranes and to analyze the influence of anharmonic effects on the membrane properties. Quantum nuclear effects turn out to be appreciable on the structural and thermodynamic properties of graphene at low temperature, and they can even be noticeable at room temperature. Such quantum effects become more relevant as the applied stress is increased, mainly for properties related to out-of-plane atomic vibrations. The relevance of quantum dynamics in the out-of-plane motion depends on the system size, and is enhanced by tensile stress. For applied tensile stresses, we analyze the contribution of the elastic energy to the internal energy of graphene. Results of PIMD simulations are compared with calculations based on a harmonic approximation for the vibrational modes of the graphene lattice. This approximation describes rather well the structural properties of graphene, provided that the frequencies of ZA (flexural) acoustic modes in the transverse direction include a pressure-dependent correction.","Trnka, T.; Tvaroska, I.; Koca, J.; Automated Training of ReaxFF Reactive Force Fields for Energetics of Enzymatic Reactions; Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation 2017, 10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00870.
ABSTRACT: Computational studies of the reaction mechanisms of various enzymes are nowadays based almost exclusively on hybrid QM/MM models. Unfortunately, the success of this approach strongly depends on the selection of the QM region, and computational cost is a crucial limiting factor. An interesting alternative is offered by empirical reactive molecular force fields, especially the ReaxFF potential developed by van Duin and co-workers. However, even though an initial parameterization of ReaxFF for biomolecules already exists, it does not provide the desired level of accuracy. We have conducted a thorough refitting of the ReaxFF force field to improve the description of reaction energetics. To minimize the human effort required, we propose a fully automated approach to generate an extensive training set comprised of thousands of different geometries and molecular fragments starting from a few model molecules. Electrostatic parameters were optimized with QM electrostatic potentials as the main target quantity, avoiding excessive dependence on the choice of reference atomic charges and improving robustness and transferability. The remaining force field parameters were optimized using the VD-CMA-ES variant of the CMA-ES optimization algorithm. This method is able to optimize hundreds of parameters simultaneously with unprecedented speed and reliability. The resulting force field was validated on a real enzymatic system, ppGalNAcT2 glycosyltransferase. The new force field offers excellent qualitative agreement with the reference QM/MM reaction energy profile, matches the relative energies of intermediate and product minima almost exactly, and reduces the overestimation of transition state energies by 27–48% compared with the previous parameterization.

"Dynamic coarse-graining fills the gap between atomistic simulations and experimental investigations of mechanical unfolding
Fabian Knoch, Ken Schafer, Gregor Diezemann, and Thomas Speck
arXiv:1710.09699v1
We present a dynamic coarse-graining technique that allows to simulate the mechanical unfolding of biomolecules or molecular complexes on experimentally relevant time scales. It is based on Markov state models (MSM), which we construct from molecular dynamics simulations using the pulling coordinate as an order parameter. We obtain a sequence of MSMs as a function of the discretized pulling coordinate, and the pulling process is modeled by switching among the MSMs according to the protocol applied to unfold the complex. This way we cover seven orders of magnitude in pulling speed. In the region of rapid pulling we additionally perform steered molecular dynamics simulations and find excellent agreement between the results of the fully atomistic and the dynamically coarse- grained simulations. Our technique allows the determination of the rates of mechanical unfolding in a dynamical range from approximately 10−8/ns to 1/ns thus reaching experimentally accessible time regimes without abandoning atomistic resolution.

ABSTRACT: Our OPLS-2009IL force field parameters (J. Chem. Theory. Comput. 2009, 5, 1038-1050) were originally developed and tested on 68 unique ionic liquids featuring the 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium [RMIM], N-alkylpyridinium [RPyr], and choline cations. Experimental validation was limited to densities and a few, largely conflicting heat of vaporization (ΔHvap) values reported in the literature at the time. Owing to the use of Monte Carlo as our sampling technique, it was also not possible to investigate the reproduction of dynamics. The [RMIM] OPLS-2009IL parameters have been revisited in this work and adapted for use in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In addition, new OPLS-AA parameters have been developed for multiple anions, i.e., AlCl4–, BF4–, Br–, Cl–, NO3–, PF6–, acetate, benzoate bis(pentafluoroethylsulfonyl)amide, bis(trifluoroethylsulfonyl)amide, dicyanamide, formate, methylsulfate, perchlorate, propionate, thiocyanate, tricyanomethanide, and trifluoromethanesulfonate. The computed solvent densities, heats of vaporization, viscosities, diffusion coefficients, heat capacities, surface tensions, and other relevant solvent data compared favorably with experiment. A charge scaling of ± 0.8 e was also investigated as a means to mimic polarization and charge transfer effects. The 0.8-scaling led to significant improvements for ΔHvap, surface tension, and self-diffusivity; however, a concern when scaling charges is the potential degradation of local intermolecular interactions at short ranges. Radial distribution functions (RDFs) were used to examine cation-anion interactions when employing 0.8*OPLS-2009IL and the scaled force field accurately reproduced RDF’s from ab initio MD simulations.

Symmetrical stretching vibrational mode of solvated Li+ and solvated Li+…TFSA- ion pair were observed at ν = 168~177 and 202~224 cm-1, respectively. Detailed structural properties of solvated Li+ and Li+…TFSA- contact ion pair were derived from the least squares fitting analysis of first-order difference function, ΔLi(Q), between neutron scattering cross sections observed for 6Li/7Li isotopically substituted 10 and 25 mol% *LiTFSA-ECd4 solutions. It has been revealed that Li+ in the 10 mol% LiTFSA solution is fully solvated by ca. 4 EC molecules. The nearest neighbor Li+…O(EC) distance and Li+…O(EC)=C(EC) bond angle are determined to be 1.90 ± 0.01 Å and 141 ± 1º, respectively. In highly concentrated 25 mol% LiTFSA-EC solution, the average solvation number of Li+ decreases to ca. 3 and ca. 1.5 TFSA- are directly contacted to Li+. These results agree well with the results of band decomposition analyses of isotropic Raman spectra for intramolecular vibrational modes of both EC and TFSA-.","Zubeltzu, J.; Artacho, E.; Simulations of water nano-confined between corrugated planes; The Journal of Chemical Physics 2017, 147, 194509.
ABSTRACT: Water confined to nanoscale widths in two dimensions between ideal planar walls has been the subject of ample study, aiming at understanding the intrinsic response of water to confinement, avoiding the consideration of the chemistry of actual confining materials. In this work, we study the response of such nanoconfined water to the imposition of a periodicity in the confinement by means of computer simulations, both using empirical potentials and from first-principles. For that we propose a periodic confining potential emulating the atomistic oscillation of the confining walls, which allows varying the lattice parameter and amplitude of the oscillation. We do it for a triangular lattice, with several values of the lattice parameter: one which is ideal for commensuration with layers of Ih ice and other values that would correspond to more realistic substrates. For the former, the phase diagram shows an overall rise of the melting temperature. The liquid maintains a bi-layer triangular structure, however, despite the fact that it is not favoured by the external periodicity. The first-principles liquid is significantly affected by the modulation in its layering and stacking even at relatively small amplitudes of the confinement modulation. Beyond some critical modulation amplitude, the hexatic phase present in flat confinement is replaced by a trilayer crystalline phase unlike any of the phases encountered for flat confinement. For more realistic lattice parameters, the liquid does not display higher tendency to freeze, but it clearly shows inhomogeneous behaviour as the strength of the rugosity increases. In spite of this expected inhomogeneity, the structural and dynamical response of the liquid is surprisingly insensitive to the external modulation. Although the first-principles calculations give a more triangular liquid than the one observed with empirical potentials (TIP4P/2005), both agree remarkably well for the main conclusions of the study.

"Un-gating and allosteric modulation of a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel captured by molecular dynamics
Nicolas E Martin, Siddharth Malik, Nicolas Calimet, Jean-Pierre Changeux, Marco Cecchini
PLoS Comput Biol 13(10): e1005784.
Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) mediate intercellular communication at synapses through the opening of an ion pore in response to the binding of a neurotransmitter. Despite the increasing availability of high-resolution structures of pLGICs, a detailed understanding of the functional isomerization from closed to open (gating) and back is currently missing. Here, we provide the first atomistic description of the transition from open to closed (un-gating) in the glutamate-gated chloride channel (GluCl) from Caenorhabditis Elegans. Starting with the active-state structure solved in complex with the neurotransmitter L-glutamate and the positive allosteric modulator (PAM) ivermectin, we analyze the spontaneous relaxation of the channel upon removal of ivermectin by explicit solvent/membrane Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. The μs-long trajectories support the conclusion that ion-channel deactivation is mediated by two distinct quaternary transitions, i.e. a global receptor twisting followed by the radial expansion (or blooming) of the extracellular domain. At variance with previous models, we show that pore closing is exclusively regulated by the global twisting, which controls the position of the β1-β2 loop relative to the M2-M3 loop at the EC/TM domain interface. Additional simulations with L-glutamate restrained to the crystallographic binding mode and ivermectin removed indicate that the same twisting isomerization is regulated by agonist binding at the orthosteric site. These results provide a structural model for gating in pLGICs and suggest a plausible mechanism for the pharmacological action of PAMs in this neurotransmitter receptor family. The simulated un-gating converges to the X-ray structure of GluCl resting state both globally and locally, demonstrating the predictive character of state-of-art MD simulations.

ABSTRACT: AcrB is the inner-membrane transporter of E. coli AcrAB-TolC tripartite efflux complex, which plays a major role in the intrinsic resistance to clinically important antibiotics. AcrB pumps a wide range of toxic substrates by utilizing the proton gradient between periplasm and cytoplasm. Crystal structures of AcrB revealed three distinct conformational states of the transport cycle, substrate access, binding and extrusion, or loose (L), tight (T) and open (O) states. However, the specific residue(s) responsible for proton binding/release and the mechanism of proton-coupled conformational cycling remain controversial. Here we use the newly developed membrane hybrid-solvent continuous constant pH molecular dynamics technique to explore the protonation states and conformational dynamics of the transmembrane domain of AcrB. Simulations show that both Asp407 and Asp408 are deprotonated in the L/T states, while only Asp408 is protonated in the O state. Remarkably, release of a proton from Asp408 in the O state results in large conformational changes, such as the lateral and vertical movement of transmembrane helices as well as the salt-bridge formation between Asp408 and Lys940 and other sidechain rearrangements among essential residues. Consistent with the crystallographic differences between the O and L protomers, simulations offer dynamic details of how proton release drives the O-to-L transition in AcrB and address the controversy regarding the proton/drug stoichiometry. This work offers a significant step towards characterizing the complete cycle of proton-coupled drug transport in AcrB and further validates the membrane hybrid-solvent CpHMD technique for studies of proton-coupled transmembrane proteins which are currently poorly understood.
","Acceleration of diffusive molecular dynamics simulations through mean field approximation and subcycling time integration

Diffusive Molecular Dynamics (DMD) is a class of recently developed computational models for the simulation of long-term diffusive mass transport at atomistic length scales. Compared to previous atomistic models, e.g., transition state theory based accelerated molecular dynamics, DMD allows the use of larger time-step sizes, but has a higher computational complexity at each time-step due to the need to solve a nonlinear optimization problem at every time-step. This paper presents two numerical methods to accelerate DMD based simulations. First, we show that when a many-body potential function, e.g., embedded atom method (EAM), is employed, the cost of DMD is dominated by the computation of the mean of the potential function and its derivatives, which are high-dimensional random variables. To reduce the cost, we explore both first- and second-order mean field approximations. Specifically, we show that the first-order approximation, which uses a point estimate to calculate the mean, can reduce the cost by two to three orders of magnitude, but may introduce relatively large error in the solution. We show that adding an approximate second-order correction term can significantly reduce the error without much increase in computational cost. Second, we show that DMD can be significantly accelerated through subcycling time integration, as the cost of integrating the empirical diffusion equation is much lower than that of the optimization solver. To assess the DMD model and the numerical approximation methods, we present two groups of numerical experiments that simulate the diffusion of hydrogen in palladium nanoparticles. In particular, we show that the computational framework is capable of capturing the propagation of an atomically sharp phase boundary over a time window of more than 30 seconds. The effects of the proposed numerical methods on solution accuracy and computation time are also assessed quantitatively.","Haider, K.; Cruz, A.; Ramsey, S.; Gilson, M.

ABSTRACT: We have developed SSTMap, a software package for mapping structural and thermodynamic water properties in molecular dynamics trajectories. The package introduces automated analysis and mapping of local measures of frustration and enhancement of water structure. The thermodynamic calculations are based on Inhomogeneous Fluid Solvation Theory (IST), which is implemented using both site-based and grid-based approaches. The package also extends the applicability of solvation analysis calculations to multiple molecular dynamics (MD) simulation programs by using existing cross-platform tools for parsing MD parameter and trajectory files. SSTMap is implemented in Python and contains both command-line tools and a Python module to facilitate flexibility in setting up calculation and for automated generation of large datasets involving analysis of multiple solutes. Output is generated in formats compatible with popular Python data science packages. This tool will be used by the molecular modeling community for computational analysis of water in problems of biophysical interest such as ligand binding and protein function.

Christoph Scherer and Denis Andrienko
arXiv, 2017, arXiv ID: 1710.02188 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.02188

Coarse-graining (CG) is a systematic reduction of the number of degrees of freedom (DOF) used to describe a system of interest. CG can be thought of as a projection on coarse-grained DOF and is therefore dependent on the functions used to represent the CG force field. In this work, we show that naive extensions of the coarse-grained force-field can result in unphysical parametrizations of the CG potential energy surface (PES). This issue can be elevated by coarse-graining the two- and three-body forces separately, which also helps to evaluate the importance of many-body interactions for a given system. The approach is illustrated on liquid water, where three-body interactions are essential to reproduce the structural properties, and liquid methanol, where two-body interactions are sufficient to reproduce the main features of the atomistic system.","Conformational analysis of spiro-epoxides by principal component analysis of molecular dynamics trajectories

Molecular dynamics simulations in explicit water are carried out to study the binding of six inhibitors to HIV-1 protease (PR) for up to 700 ns using the standard AMBER force field and polarized protein-specific charge (PPC). PPC is derived from quantum mechanical calculation for protein in solution and therefore it includes electronic polarization effect. Our results show that in all six systems, the bridging water W301 drifts away from the binding pocket in AMBER simulation. However, it is very stable in all six complexes systems using PPC. Especially, intra-protease, protease-inhibitor hydrogen bonds are dynamic stabilized in MD simulation. The computed binding free energies of six complexes have a significantly linear correlation with those experiment values and the correlation coefficient is found to be 0.91 in PPC simulation. However, the result from AMBER simulation shows a weaker correlation with the correlation coefficient of −0.51 due to the lack of polarization effect. Detailed binding interactions of W301, inhibitors with PR are further analyzed and discussed. The present study provides important information to quantitative understanding the interaction mechanism of PR-inhibitor and PR-W301 and these data also emphasizes the importance of both the electronic polarization and the bridging water molecule in predicting precisely binding affinities.

Hybrid simulations, in which a part of the system is treated with atomistic resolution and the remainder is represented on a coarse-grained level, allow for fast sampling while using the accuracy of atomistic force fields. We apply a hybrid scheme to study the mechanical unfolding and refolding of a molecular complex using force probe molecular dynamics (FPMD) simulations. The degrees of freedom of the solvent molecules are treated in a coarse-grained manner while atomistic resolution is retained for the solute. The coupling between the solvent and the solute is provided using virtual sites. We test two  different  common  coarse-graining  procedures,  the  iterative  Boltzmann  inversion  method  and the force matching procedure, and find that both methodologies give similar results. The results of the FPMD simulations are compared to all-atom simulations of the same system and we find that differences between these simulations and the ones using the hybrid scheme are in a similar range as the differences obtained when using different atomistic force fields. Thus, a hybrid scheme yields qualitatively  correct  results  in  the  strong  non-equilibrium  situation  the  system  is  experiencing  in FPMD simulations.",,"

A novel statistical procedure has been developed
to optimize the parameters of non-bonded force fields of metal ions in soft
matter. The criterion for the optimization is the minimization of the
deviations from ab initio forces and energies calculated for model systems. The
method exploits the combination of the linear ridge regression and the
cross-validation techniques with the differential evolution algorithm. Wide
freedom in the choice of the functional form of the force fields is allowed
since both linear and non-linear parameters can be optimized. In order to
maximize the information content of the data employed in the fitting procedure,
the composition of the training set is entrusted to a combinatorial optimization
algorithm which maximizes the dissimilarity of the included instances. The
methodology has been validated using the force field parametrization of five
metal ions (Zn2+, Ni2+, Mg2+, Ca2+, and Na+) in water as test cases.

To better understand animal cell plasma membranes, we studied simplified models, namely four-component lipid bilayer mixtures. Here we describe the domain size transition in the region of coexisting liquid-disordered (Ld) + liquid-ordered (Lo) phases. This transition occurs abruptly in composition space with domains increasing in size by two orders of magnitude, from tens of nanometers to microns. We measured the line tension between coexisting Ld and Lo domains close to the domain size transition for a variety of lipid mixtures, finding that in every case the transition occurs at a line tension of ∼0.3 pN. A computational model incorporating line tension and dipole repulsion indicated that even small changes in line tension can result in domains growing in size by several orders of magnitude, consistent with experimental observations. We find that other properties of the coexisting Ld and Lo phases do not change significantly in the vicinity of the abrupt domain size transition.

Amoeboid cells propel by generating pseudopods that are finger-like protrusions of the cell body that continually grow, bifurcate, and retract. Pseudopod-driven motility of amoeboid cells represents a complex and multiscale process that involves bio-molecular reactions, cell deformation, and cyto-plasmic and extracellular fluid motion. Here we present a 3D model of pseudopod-driven swimming of an amoeba suspended in a fluid without any adhesion and in the absence of any chemoattractant. Our model is based on front-tracking/immersed-boundary methods, and it combines large deformation of the cell, a coarse-grain model for molecular reactions, and cytoplasmic and extracellular fluid flow. The predicted shapes of the swimming cell from our model show similarity with experimental observations. We predict that the swimming behavior changes from random-like to persistent uni-directional motion, and that the swimming speed increases, with increasing cell deformability and protein diffusivity. The unidirectionality in cell swimming is observed without any external cues and as a direct result of a change in pseudopod dynamics. We find that pseudopods become preferentially focused near the front of the cell and appear in greater numbers with increasing cell deformability and protein diffusivity, thereby increasing the swimming speed and making the cell shape more elongated. We find that the swimming speed is minimum when the cytoplasm viscosity is close to the extracellular fluid viscosity. We further find that the speed increases significantly as the cytoplasm becomes less viscous compared with the extracellular fluid, resembling the viscous fingering phenomenon observed in interfacial flows. While these results support the notion that softer cells migrate more aggressively, they also suggest a strong coupling between membrane elasticity, membrane protein diffusivity, and fluid viscosity.",,"

strongest known non-covalent interactions in nature, and is heavily used across
the biotechnological industry. In this work we gain understanding of the
molecular determinants and bottlenecks in the dissociation of the dimeric
biotin-streptavidin system in wild type and with a point mutation. Using new enhanced
sampling methods with full atomistic resolution, we reproduce the
experimentally reported effect of the mutation on the dissociation rate. We
also answer a longstanding question regarding cause/effect in the coupled
events of bond stretching and bond hydration during dissociation and establish
that in this system, it is the bond stretching and not hydration which forms
the bottleneck in the early parts of the dissociation process. We believe these
calculations represent a step forward in the use of atomistic simulations to
study pharmacodynamics. An improved understanding of biotin-streptavidin
dissociation dynamics should also have direct benefits in biotechnological and
nanobiotechnological applications.

Genome packing in viruses and prokaryotes relies on positively charged ions to reduce electrostatic repulsions, and induce attractions that can facilitate DNA condensation. Here we present molecular dynamics simulations spanning several microseconds of dsDNA packing inside nanometer-sized viral capsids. We use a detailed molecular model of DNA that accounts for molecular structure, basepairing, and explicit counterions. The size and shape of the capsids studied here are based on the 30-nanometer-diameter gene transfer agents of bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus that transfer random 4.5-kbp (1.5 μm) DNA segments between bacterial cells. Multivalent cations such as spermidine and magnesium induce attraction between packaged DNA sites that can lead to DNA condensation. At high concentrations of spermidine, this condensation significantly increases the shear stresses on the packaged DNA while also reducing the pressure inside the capsid. These effects result in an increase in the packing velocity and the total amount of DNA that can be packaged inside the nanometer-sized capsids. In the simulation results presented here, high concentrations of spermidine3+ did not produce the premature stalling observed in experiments. However, a small increase in the heterogeneity of packing velocities was observed in the systems with magnesium and spermidine ions compared to the system with only salt. The results presented here indicate that the effect of multivalent cations and of spermidine, in particular, on the dynamics of DNA packing, increases with decreasing packing velocities.",

Abstract
We present a study on the optimization of the updating magnitude for a class of free energy methods based on flat-distribution sampling, including the Wang-Landau (WL) algorithm and metadynamics. These methods rely on adaptive construction of a bias potential that offsets the potential of mean force by histogram-based updates. The convergence of the bias potential can be improved by decreasing the updating magnitude with an optimal schedule. We show that while the asymptotically optimal schedule for the single-bin updating scheme (commonly used in the WL algorithm) is given by the known inverse-time formula, that for the Gaussian updating scheme (commonly used in metadynamics) is often more complex. We further show that the single-bin updating scheme is optimal for very long simulations, and it can be generalized to a class of bandpass updating schemes that are similarly optimal. These bandpass updating schemes target only a few long-range distribution modes and their optimal schedule is also given by the inverse-time formula. Constructed from orthogonal polynomials, the bandpass updating schemes generalize the WL and Langfeld-Lucini-Rago algorithms as an automatic parameter tuning scheme for umbrella sampling.

Abstract
The self-assembly of surfactants into lyotropic liquid crystalline phases is interesting from a fundamental and practical perspective. The propensity for self-assembly is particularly interesting in Gemini surfactants which have a very low critical micelle concentration. In this work we study the effect of head-group identity on the driving force for the self-assembly of Gemini surfactants, using computer simulations of the potential of mean force (PMF). We find that surfactants with sulfonate head-groups have a greater tendency to assemble than those with carboxylate head-groups. The minimum in the PMF is about a factor of two deeper and occurs at shorter distances. Interestingly, the driving force is entropic with the carobxylate and energetic with the sulfonate head-groups. Analysis of different contributions suggests that these differences arise from surfactant headgroup electrostatics and size. The results provide an explanation for why the morphology diagram of the sulfonate surfactants is insensitive to temperature.",,"Reference: The Journal of Chemical Physics 147, 184104 (2017); https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4996204",,

Abstract
The coarse-graining approach to deriving the quantum Markovian master equation is revisited, with close attention given to the underlying approximations. It is further argued that the time interval over which the coarse-graining is performed is a free parameter that can be given a physical measurement-based interpretation. In the case of the damping of composite systems to reservoirs of different temperatures, currently of much interest in the study of quantum thermal machines with regard to the validity of `local' and `global' forms of these equations, the coupling of the subsystems leads to a further timescale with respect to which the coarse-graining time interval can be chosen. Different choices lead to different master equations that correspond to the local and global forms. These can be then understood as having different physical interpretations based on the role of the coarse-graining, as well as different limitations in application.

Nonetheless, the appearance of a gel phase for DOPC is strictly dependent on the intramolecular parameters chosen to model its molecular structure. In particular, we show that the bending angle at the coarse-grained bead corresponding to the unsaturated carbon-carbon bond acts as an order parameter determining the temperature of the phase transition. Structural analysis of the molecular dynamics simulations runs evidences that in the gel phase, the packing of the lipophilic tails of DOPC assume a different conformation than in the liquid phase. In the latter phase, the DOPC geometry resembles that of the relaxed free molecule.

"Coarse-grained molecular dynamics studies of the structure and stability of peptide-based drug amphiphile filaments

Peptide-based supramolecular filaments, in particular filaments self-assembled by drug amphiphiles (DAs), possess great potential in the field of drug delivery. These filaments possess one hundred percent drug loading, with a release mechanism that can be tuned based on the dissociation of the supramolecular filaments and the degradation of the DAs [Cheetham et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2013, 135(8), 2907]. Recently, much attention has been drawn to the competing intermolecular interactions that drive the self-assembly of peptide-based amphiphiles into supramolecular filaments. Recently, we reported on long-time atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to characterize the structure and growth of chiral filaments by the self-assembly of a DA containing the aromatic anti-cancer drug camptothecin [Kang et al., Macromolecules, 2016, 49(3), 994]. We found that the π–π stacking of the aromatic drug governs the early stages of the self-assembly process, while also contributing towards the chirality of the self-assembled filament. Based on these all-atomistic simulations, we now build a chemically accurate coarse-grained model that can capture the structure and stability of these supramolecular filaments at long time-scales (microseconds). These coarse-grained models successfully recapitulate the growth of the molecular clusters (and their elongation trends) compared with previously reported atomistic simulations. Furthermore, the interfacial structure and the helicity of the filaments are conserved. Next, we focus on characterization of the disassembly process of a 0.675 μm DA filament at microsecond time-scales. These results provide very useful tools for the rational design of functional supramolecular filaments, in particular supramolecular filaments for drug delivery applications.",,"Data-driven reduced-order model of microtubule mechanics      Yan Feng and Sorin Mitran  Cytoskeleton, Accepted Manuscript, DOI: 10.1002/cm.21419","Dispersion Interactions in QM/EFP

The dispersion energy term between quantum-mechanical (QM) and classical (represented by effective fragment potentials, EFP) subsystems is developed and implemented. A new formulation is based on long-range perturbation theory and uses dynamic polarizability tensors of the effective fragments and electric field integrals and orbital energies of the quantum-mechanical subsystem. No parametrization is involved. The accuracy of the QM–EFP dispersion energy is tested on a number of model systems; the average mean unsigned error is 0.8 kcal/mol or 13% with respect to the symmetry adapted perturbation theory on the S22 data set of noncovalent interactions. The computational cost of the dispersion energy computation is low compared to the self-consistent field calculation of the QM subsystem. The dispersion energy is sensitive to the level of theory employed for the QM part and to the electrostatic interactions in the system. The latter means that the dispersion interactions in the QM/EFP method are not purely two-body but have more complex many-body behavior.

"Optimising minimal building blocks for addressable self-assembly.

Addressable structures are characterised by the set of unique components from which they are built and by the specific location that each component occupies. For an addressable structure to self-assemble, its constituent building blocks must be encoded with sufficient information to define their positions with respect to each other and to enable them to navigate to those positions. DNA, with its vast scope for encoding specific interactions, has been successfully used to synthesise addressable systems of several hundred components. In this work we examine the complementary question of the minimal requirements for building blocks to undergo addressable self-assembly driven by a controlled temperature quench. Our testbed is an idealised model of cubic particles patterned with attractive interactions. We introduce a scheme for optimising the interactions using a variant of basin-hopping and a negative design principle. The designed building blocks are tested dynamically in simple target structures to establish how their complexity affects the limits of reliable self-assembly.","Chemically specific coarse-grained models to investigate the structure of biomimetic membranes

Biomimetic polymer/protein membranes are promising materials for DNA sequencing, sensors, drug delivery and water purification. These self-assembled structures are made from low molecular weight amphiphilic block copolymers (Nhydrophobic < 40 for a diblock copolymer), including poly(ethylene oxide)–1,2-polybutadiene (EO–1,2-BD) and poly(ethylene oxide)–poly(ethyl ethylene) (EO–EE). To examine these membranes' nanoscale structure, we developed a coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG MD) model for EO–1,2-BD and assembled a CG MD model for EO–EE using parameters from two published force fields. We observe that the polymers' hydrophobic core blocks are slightly stretched compared to the random coil configuration seen at higher molecular weights. We also observe an increase in the interdigitation of the hydrophobic leaflets with increasing molecular weight (consistent with literature). The hydration level of the EO corona (which may influence protein incorporation) is higher for membranes with a larger area/chain, regardless of whether EE or 1,2-BD forms the hydrophobic block. Our results provide a molecular-scale view of membrane packing and hydrophobicity, two important properties for creating polymer–protein biomimetic membranes.","How Well Can Implicit Solvent Simulations Explore FoldingPathway?

Abstract: Five molecular models for trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) to be used in conjunction with compatible models for liquid water are evaluated by comparison of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation results to experimental data as functions of TMAO molality. The experimental data comprise thermodynamic properties (density, apparent molar volume, and partial molar volume at infinite dilution), transport properties (self-diffusion and shear viscosity), structural properties (radial distribution functions and degree of hydrogen bonding), and dielectric properties (dielectric spectra and static permittivity). The thermodynamic and transport properties turned out to be useful in TMAO model discrimination while the influence of the water model and the TMAO–water interaction are effectively probed through the calculation of dielectric spectra.

Abstract:The NEET proteins are a novel family of iron–sulfur proteins characterized by an unusual three cysteine and one histidine coordinated [2Fe–2S] cluster. Aberrant cluster release, facilitated by the breakage of the Fe–N bond, is implicated in a variety of human diseases, including cancer. Here, the molecular dynamics in the multi-microsecond timescale, along with quantum chemical calculations, on two representative members of the family (the human NAF-1 and mitoNEET proteins), show that the loss of the cluster is associated with a dramatic decrease in secondary and tertiary structure. In addition, the calculations provide a mechanism for cluster release and clarify, for the first time, crucial differences existing between the two proteins, which are reflected in the experimentally observed difference in the pH-dependent cluster reactivity. The reliability of our conclusions is established by an extensive comparison with the NMR data of the solution proteins, in part measured in this work.

Abstract: The structure and dynamics of solvation shells of the phosphate ion in deuterated water are studied by means of Born–Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulation. The total number of molecules in the first and second solvation shells is found to be close to the effective hydration number reported experimentally. The OD bonds that are hydrogen bonded to the phosphate ion are found to be red shifted as compared to bulk water, which is consistent with experimental results. However, the two OD bonds of the same water molecule in the first hydration shell are found to be vibrationally distinct, which can be attributed to different strengths of the ion–water and water–water hydrogen bonds near the ion. Also, the hydrogen bonds formed by the second solvation shell OD bonds are somewhat stronger than the bulk. This finding shows a long ranged effect of the phosphate ion on water and also gives insights into the water structure making property of this anion. The dynamics of water in the first solvation shell is found to be significantly slower than that of the bulk. We have investigated the origin of the orientational slowing down of the first solvation shell water molecules and made connections to similar results observed experimentally.

Abstract
The coarse-grained Martini model is employed extensively to study membrane protein oligomerization. While this approach is exceptionally promising given its computational efficiency, it is alarming that a significant fraction of these studies demonstrate unrealistic protein clusters, whose formation is essentially an irreversible process. This suggests that the protein–protein interactions are exaggerated in the Martini model. If this held true, then it would limit the applicability of Martini to study multi-protein complexes, as the rapidly clustering proteins would not be able to properly sample the correct dimerization conformations. In this work we first demonstrate the excessive protein aggregation by comparing the dimerization free energies of helical transmembrane peptides obtained with the Martini model to those determined from FRET experiments. Second, we show that the predictions provided by the Martini model for the structures of transmembrane domain dimers are in poor agreement with the corresponding structures resolved using NMR. Next, we demonstrate that the first issue can be overcome by slightly scaling down the Martini protein–protein interactions in a manner, which does not interfere with the other Martini interaction parameters. By preventing excessive, irreversible, and non-selective aggregation of membrane proteins, this approach renders the consideration of lateral dynamics and protein–lipid interactions in crowded membranes by the Martini model more realistic. However, this adjusted model does not lead to an improvement in the predicted dimer structures. This implicates that the poor agreement between the Martini model and NMR structures cannot be cured by simply uniformly reducing the interactions between all protein beads. Instead, a careful amino-acid specific adjustment of the protein–protein interactions is likely required.

We introduce a computational framework that is able to describe general many-body coarse-grained (CG) interactions of molecules and use it to model the free energy surface of molecular liquids as a cluster expansion in terms of monomer, dimer, and trimer terms. The contributions to the free energy due to these terms are inferred from all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) data using Gaussian Approximation Potentials, a type of machine-learning model that employs Gaussian process regression. The resulting CG model is much more accurate than those possible using pair potentials. While slower than the latter, our model can still be faster than all-atom simulations for solvent-free CG models commonly used in biomolecular simulations.

Abstract
In this Letter, we evaluate the relationship between aqueous hydrogen bonding and interfacial molecular structure at the liquid water-vapor interface. We present a mean-field model of interfacial structure that can be used to compute the depth dependent orientational distribution of water molecules. Using this model we demonstrate that the primary features of water's interfacial molecular structure reflect the hydrogen bonding preferences of individual water molecules immersed within the anisotropic mean interfacial density field. We find that the polarization and polarizability of the interfacial environment are sensitive to distortions in the hydrogen bonding network that arise due to correlated molecular interactions. We identify a specific type of three-body hydrogen bond defect that is preferentially stabilized at the interface and contributes significantly to these interfacial properties. Our results reveal that the dielectric properties of the liquid water interfaces are influenced by collective molecular interactions that are unique to the interfacial environment..

Abstract
Efficient coarse-grained (CG) models can be coupled with atomistic force fields to accelerate the sampling of atomistic energy landscapes in the multi-scale enhanced sampling (MSES) framework. This approach may be particularly suitable for generating atomistic conformational ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). While MSES is relatively robust to inherent CG artifacts, achieving optimal sampling efficiency requires CG modeling to generate local and long-range fluctuations that are largely consistent with those at the atomistic level. Here, we describe a new hybrid resolution CG model (HyRes) for MSES simulations of disordered protein states, which is specifically designed to provide semi-quantitative secondary structure propensities together with a qualitative description of long-range nonspecific interactions. The HyRes model contains an atomistic description of the backbone with intermediate resolution side chains. The secondary structure propensities are tuned by adjusting the backbone hydrogen-bonding strength and  torsion profile. The sizes and covalent geometries of side chains are parameterized to reproduce distributions derived from atomistic simulations. Lennard-Jones parameters for sidechain beads are assigned to reproduce statistical potentials derived from protein structural database, and then globally parameterized with nonspecific electrostatic interactions to reproduce free energy profiles of pair wise interactions and key conformational properties of model peptides. Application of HyRes to MSES simulations of small IDPs suggests that it is capable of driving faster structural transitions at the atomistic level and increasing the convergence rate compared to Cα-only Gō-like models previously utilized. With further optimization, we believe that the new CG model could greatly improve the efficiency of MSES simulations of larger and more complex IDPs frequently involved in cellular signaling and regulation.

Beneath a surface region comprising approximately two molecular layers, the pressure tensor becomes approximately isotropic and constant with r. We find that the dependence of the pressure on droplet radius is that expected from the Young-Laplace equation, despite the small size of the droplets..

Abstract
The unique properties of liquid water apparently arise from more than just the tetrahedral bond angle between the nuclei of a water molecule since simple three-site models of water are poor at mimicking these properties in computer simulations. Four- and five-site models add partial charges on dummy sites and are better at modeling these properties, which suggests that the shape of charge distribution is important. Since a multipole expansion of the electrostatic potential describes a charge distribution in an orthogonal basis set that is exact in the limit of infinite order, multipoles may be an even better way to model the charge distribution. In particular, molecular multipoles up to the octupole centered on the oxygen appear to describe the electrostatic potential from electronic structure calculations better than four- and five-site models, and molecular multipole models give better agreement with the temperature and pressure dependence of many liquid state properties of water while retaining the computational efficiency of three-site models. Here, the influence of the shape of the molecular charge distribution on liquid state properties is examined by correlating multipoles of non-polarizable water models with their liquid state properties in computer simulations. This will aid in the development of accurate water models for classical simulations as well as in determining the accuracy needed in quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical studies and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of water. More fundamentally, this will lead to a greater understanding of how the charge distribution of a water molecule leads to the unique properties of liquid water. In particular, these studies indicate that p-orbital charge out of the molecular plane is important..

","Dynamic coarse-graining fills the gap between atomistic simulations and experimental investigations of mechanical unfolding

https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09699

We present a dynamic coarse-graining technique that allows to simulate the mechanical unfolding of biomolecules or molecular complexes on experimentally relevant time scales. It is based on Markov state models (MSM), which we construct from molecular dynamics simulations using the pulling coordinate as an order parameter. We obtain a sequence of MSMs as a function of the discretized pulling coordinate, and the pulling process is modeled by switching among the MSMs according to the protocol applied to unfold the complex. This way we cover seven orders of magnitude in pulling speed. In the region of rapid pulling we additionally perform steered molecular dynamics simulations and find excellent agreement between the results of the fully atomistic and the dynamically coarse-grained simulations. Our technique allows the determination of the rates of mechanical unfolding in a dynamical range from approximately 10−8/ns to 1/ns thus reaching experimentally accessible time regimes without abandoning atomistic resolution.

THE JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS 147, 152725
We show how accurate rates of formation and dissociation of peptide dimers can be calculated using direct transition counting (DTC) from replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations. First, continuous trajectories corresponding to system replicas evolving at different temperatures are used to assign conformational states. Second, we analyze the entire REMD data to calculate the corresponding rates at each temperature directly from the number of transition counts. Finally, we compare the kinetics extracted directly, using the DTC method, with indirect estimations based on trajectory likelihood maximization using short-time propagators and on decay rates of state autocor- relation functions. For systems with relatively low-dimensional intrinsic conformational dynamics, the DTC method is simple to implement and leads to accurate temperature-dependent rates. We apply the DTC rate-extraction method to all-atom REMD simulations of dimerization of amyloid-forming NNQQ tetrapetides in explicit water. In an assessment of the REMD sampling efficiency with respect to standard MD, we find a gain of more than a factor of two at the lowest temperature.

The actin cytoskeleton powers membrane deformation during many cellular processes, such as migration, morphogenesis, and endocytosis. Membrane phosphoinositides, especially phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2], regulate the activities of many actin-binding proteins (ABPs), including profilin, cofilin, Dia2, N-WASP, ezrin, and moesin, but the underlying molecular mechanisms have remained elusive. Moreover, because of a lack of available methodology, the dynamics of membrane interactions have not been experimentally determined for any ABP. Here, we applied a combination of biochemical assays, photobleaching/activation approaches, and atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to uncover the molecular principles by which ABPs interact with phosphoinositide-rich membranes. We show that, despite using different domains for lipid binding, these proteins associate with membranes through similar multivalent electrostatic interactions, without specific binding pockets or penetration into the lipid bilayer. Strikingly, our experiments reveal that these proteins display enormous differences in the dynamics of membrane interactions and in the ranges of phosphoinositide densities that they sense. Profilin and cofilin display transient, low-affinity interactions with phosphoinositide-rich membranes, whereas F-actin assembly factors Dia2 and N-WASP reside on phosphoinositide-rich membranes for longer periods to perform their functions. Ezrin and moesin, which link the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane, bind membranes with very high affinity and slow dissociation dynamics. Unlike profilin, cofilin, Dia2, and N-WASP, they do not require high “stimulus-responsive” phosphoinositide density for membrane binding. Moreover, ezrin can limit the lateral diffusion of PI(4,5)P2 along the lipid bilayer. Together, these findings demonstrate that membrane-interaction mechanisms of ABPs evolved to precisely fulfill their specific functions in cytoskeletal dynamics.

Ab initio quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) molecular dynamics simulation is a useful tool to calculate thermodynamic properties such as potential of mean force for chemical reactions but intensely time consuming. In this paper, we developed a new method using the internal force correction for low-level semiempirical QM/MM molecular dynamics samplings with a predefined reaction coordinate. As a correction term, the internal force was predicted with a machine learning scheme, which provides a sophisticated force field, and added to the atomic forces on the reaction coordinate related atoms at each integration step. We applied this method to two reactions in aqueous solution and reproduced potentials of mean force at the ab initio QM/MM level. The saving in computational cost is about 2 orders of magnitude. The present work reveals great potentials for machine learning in QM/MM simulations to study complex chemical processes.
","Reliability Assessment for Large-Scale Molecular Dynamics Approximations

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used in biochemistry, physics, and other fields to study the motions, thermodynamic properties, and the interactions between molecules. Computational limitations and the complexity of these problems, however, create the need for approximations to the standard MD methods and for uncertainty quantification and reliability assessment of those approximations. In this paper, we exploit the intrinsic two-scale nature of MD to construct a class of large-scale dynamics approximations. The reliability of these methods are evaluated here by measuring the differences between full, classical MD simulations and those based on these large-scale approximations. Molecular dynamics evolutions are non-linear and chaotic, so the complete details of molecular evolutions cannot be accurately predicted even using full, classical MD simulations. This paper provides numerical results that demonstrate the existence of computationally efficient large-scale MD approximations which accurately model certain large-scale properties of the molecules: the energy, the linear and angular momenta, and other macroscopic features of molecular motions.

Luigi Sbailò, Frank Noé
https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07798

Molecular Dynamics - Green's Functions Reaction Dynamics (MD-GFRD) is a multiscale simulation method for particle dynamics or particle-based reaction-diffusion dynamics that is suited for systems involving low particle densities. Particles in a low-density region are just diffusing and not interacting. In this case one can avoid the costly integration of microscopic equations of motion, such as molecular dynamics (MD), and instead turn to an event-based scheme in which the times to the next particle interaction and the new particle positions at that time can be sampled. At high (local) concentrations, however, e.g. when particles are interacting in a nontrivial way, particle positions must still be updated with small time steps of the microscopic dynamical equations. The efficiency of a multi-scale simulation that uses these two schemes largely depends on the coupling between them and the decisions when to switch between the two scales. Here we present an efficient scheme for multi-scale MD-GFRD simulations. It has been shown that MD-GFRD schemes are more efficient than brute-force molecular dynamics simulations up to a molar concentration of 102μM. In this paper, we show that the choice of the propagation domains has a relevant impact on the computational performance. Domains are constructed using a local optimization of their sizes and a minimal domain size is proposed. The algorithm is shown to be more efficient than brute-force Brownian dynamics simulations up to a molar concentration of 103μM and is up to an order of magnitude more efficient compared with previous MD-GFRD schemes.

The bottom-up prediction of the properties of polymeric materials based on molecular dynamics simulation is a major challenge in soft matter physics. Coarse-grained (CG) models are often employed to access greater spatiotemporal scales required for many applications, but these models normally experience significantly altered thermodynamics and highly accelerated dynamics due to the reduced number of degrees of freedom upon coarse-graining. While CG models can be calibrated to meet certain properties at particular state points, there is unfortunately no temperature transferable and chemically specific coarse-graining method that allows for modeling of polymer dynamics over a wide temperature range. Here, we pragmatically address this problem by “correcting” for deviations in activation free energies that occur upon coarse-graining the dynamics of a model polymeric material (polystyrene). In particular, we propose a new strategy based on concepts drawn from the Adam–Gibbs (AG) theory of glass formation. Namely we renormalize the cohesive interaction strength and effective interaction length-scale parameters to modify the activation free energy. We show that this energy-renormalization method for CG modeling allows accurate prediction of atomistic dynamics over the Arrhenius regime, the non-Arrhenius regime of glass formation, and even the non-equilibrium glassy regime, thus allowing for the predictive modeling of dynamic properties of polymer over the entire range of glass formation. Our work provides a practical scheme for establishing temperature transferable coarse-grained models for predicting and designing the properties of polymeric materials.",,"Protein-peptide association kinetics beyond the seconds timescale from atomistic simulations

Understanding and control of structures and rates involved in protein ligand binding are essential for drug design. Unfortunately, atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations cannot directly sample the excessively long residence and rearrangement times of tightly binding complexes. Here we exploit the recently developed multi-ensemble Markov model framework to compute full protein-peptide kinetics of the oncoprotein fragment 25–109Mdm2 and the nano-molar inhibitor peptide PMI. Using this system, we report, for the first time, direct estimates of kinetics beyond the seconds timescale using simulations of an all-atom MD model, with high accuracy and precision. These results only require explicit simulations on the sub-milliseconds timescale and are tested against existing mutagenesis data and our own experimental measurements of the dissociation and association rates. The full kinetic model reveals an overall downhill but rugged binding funnel with multiple pathways. The overall strong binding arises from a variety of conformations with different hydrophobic contact surfaces that interconvert on the milliseconds timescale.

One of the major challenges in atomistic simulations of proteins is efficient sampling of pathways associated with rare conformational transitions. Recent developments in statistical methods for computation of direct evolutionary couplings between amino acids within and across polypeptide chains have allowed for inference of native residue contacts, informing accurate prediction of protein folds and multimeric structures. In this study, we assess the use of distances between evolutionarily coupled residues as natural choices for reaction coordinates which can be incorporated into Markov state model-based adaptive sampling schemes and potentially used to predict not only functional conformations but also pathways of conformational change, protein folding, and protein-protein association. We demonstrate the utility of evolutionary couplings in sampling and predicting activation pathways of the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR), folding of the FiP35 WW domain, and dimerization of the E. coli molybdopterin synthase subunits. We find that the time required for β2-AR activation and folding of the WW domain are greatly diminished using evolutionary couplings-guided adaptive sampling. Additionally, we were able to identify putative molybdopterin synthase association pathways and near-crystal structure complexes from protein-protein association simulations.",

The determination of potentials of mean force for solute insertion in a membrane by means of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations is often hampered by sampling issues. A multiscale approach to conformational sampling was recently proposed by Bereau and Kremer (2016). It aims at accelerating the sampling of the atomistic conformational space by means of a systematic backmapping of coarse-grained snapshots. In this work, we first analyze the efficiency of this method by comparing its predictions for propanol insertion into a 1,2-Dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine membrane (DMPC) against reference atomistic simulations. The method is found to provide accurate results with a gain of one order of magnitude in computational time. We then investigate the role of the coarse-grained representation in affecting the reliability of the method in the case of a 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine membrane (DOPC). We find that the accuracy of the results is tightly connected to the presence a good configurational overlap between the coarse-grained and atomistic models—a general requirement when developing multiscale simulation methods.",

ABSTRACT: The recently proposed Hamiltonian adaptive resolution scheme (H-AdResS) allows the performance of molecular simulations in an open boundary framework. It allows changing, on the fly, the resolution of specific subsets of molecules (usually the solvent), which are free to diffuse between the atomistic region and the coarse-grained reservoir. So far, the method has been successfully applied to pure liquids. Coupling the H-AdResS methodology to hybrid models of proteins, such as the molecular mechanics/coarse-grained (MM/CG) scheme, is a promising approach for rigorous calculations of ligand binding free energies in low-resolution protein models. Toward this goal, here we apply for the first time H-AdResS to two atomistic proteins in dual-resolution solvent, proving its ability to reproduce structural and dynamic properties of both the proteins and the solvent, as obtained from atomistic simulations.

ABSTRACT: Early oligomerization during amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregation is essential for Aβ neurotoxicity. Understanding how unstructured Aβs assemble into oligomers, especially those rich in β-sheets, is essential but remains challenging as the assembly process is too transient for experimental characterization and too slow for molecular dynamics simulations. So far, atomic simulations are limited only to studies of either oligomer structures or assembly pathways for short Aβ segments. To overcome the computational challenge, we combine in this study a hybrid-resolution model and adaptive sampling techniques to perform over 2.7 ms of simulations of formation of full-length Aβ40 dimers that are the earliest toxic oligomeric species. The Markov state model is further employed to characterize the transition pathways and associated kinetics. Our results show that for two major forms of β-sheet-rich structures reported experimentally, the corresponding assembly mechanisms are markedly different. Hairpin-containing structures are formed by direct binding of soluble Aβ in β-hairpin-like conformations. Formation of parallel, in-register structures resembling fibrils occurs ∼100-fold more slowly and involves a rapid encounter of Aβ in arbitrary conformations followed by a slow structural conversion. The structural conversion proceeds via diverse pathways but always requires transient unfolding of encounter complexes. We find that the transition kinetics could be affected differently by intra-/intermolecular interactions involving individual residues in a conformation-dependent manner. In particular, the interactions involving Aβ’s N-terminal part promote the assembly into hairpin-containing structures but delay the formation of fibril-like structures, thus explaining puzzling observations reported previously regarding the roles of this region in the early assembly process.",

Several recent implementations of algorithms for sampling reaction pathways employ a strategy for placing interfaces or milestones across the reaction coordinate manifold. Interfaces can be introduced such that the full feature space describing the dynamics of a macromolecule is divided into Voronoi (or other) cells, and the global kinetics of the molecular motions can be calculated from the set of fluxes through the interfaces between the cells. Although some methods of this type are exact for an arbitrary set of cells, in practice, the calculations will converge fastest when the interfaces are placed in regions where they can best capture transitions between configurations corresponding to local minima. The aim of this paper is to introduce a fully automated machine-learning algorithm for defining a set of cells for use in kinetic sampling methodologies based on subdividing the dynamical feature space; the algorithm requires no intuition about the system or input from the user and scales to high-dimensional systems.",

Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling Just Accepted Manuscript. 
Markov State Models (MSM) are used to model the kinetics of processes sampled by Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. MSM reduce the high dimensionality inherent to MD simulations as they partition the free energy landscape into discrete states, generating a kinetic model as a series of uncorrelated jumps between states. Here, we detail a new method, called GRadient Adaptive Decomposition, which optimizes coarse-grained MSM by refining borders with respect to the gradient along the free energy surface. The proposed method requires only a small number of initial microstates because it corrects for errors produced by limited sampling. Whereas many methods rely on fuzzy partitions for proper statistics, GRAD retains a crisp decomposition. Two test studies are presented to illustrate the method and assess its accuracy: the first analyzes MSM of idealized model potentials while the second is a study of the dynamics of unstacking of the Deoxyribose Adenosine Dinucleotide monophosphate dinucleotide.",

Hybrid all-atom/coarse-grained (AA/CG) simulations of proteins offer a computationally efficient compromise where atomistic details are only applied to biologically relevant regions while benefiting from the speedup of treating the remaining parts of a given system at the CG level. The recently developed CG model, PRIMO, allows a direct coupling with an atomistic force field with no additional modifications or coupling terms and the ability to carry out dynamic simulations without any restraints on secondary or tertiary structures. A hybrid AA/CG scheme based on combining all-atom CHARMM and coarse-grained PRIMO representations was validated via molecular dynamics and replica exchange simulations of soluble and membrane proteins. The AA/CG scheme was also tested in the calculation of the free energy profile for the transition from the closed to the open state of adenylate kinase via umbrella sampling molecular dynamics method. The overall finding is that the AA/CG scheme generates dynamics and energetics that are qualitatively and quantitatively comparable to AA simulations while offering the computational advantages of coarse-graining. This model opens the door to challenging applications where high accuracy is required only in parts of large biomolecular complexes.",

We recently showed that the time-structure-based independent component analysis method from Markov state model literature provided a set of variationally optimal slow collective variables for metadynamics (tICA-metady- namics). In this paper, we extend the methodology toward efficient sampling of related mutants by borrowing ideas from transfer learning methods in machine learning. Our method explicitly assumes that a similar set of slow modes and metastable states is found in both the wild type (baseline) and its mutants. Under this assumption, we describe a few simple techniques using sequence mapping for transferring the slow modes and structural information contained in the wild type simulation to a mutant model for performing enhanced sampling. The resulting simulations can then be reweighted onto the full-phase space using the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio, allowing for thermodynamic comparison against the wild type. We first benchmark our methodology by recapturing alanine dipeptide dynamics across a range of different atomistic force fields, including the polarizable Amoeba force field, after learning a set of slow modes using Amber ff99sb-ILDN. We next extend the method by including structural data from the wild type simulation and apply the technique to recapturing the effects of the GTT mutation on the FIP35 WW domain

Colloidal particles with short-ranged attractions, e.g., micron-scale spheres functionalized with single- stranded DNA oligomers, are susceptible to becoming trapped in disordered configurations even when a crystalline arrangement is the ground state. Moreover, for reasons that are not well understood, seemingly minor variations in the particle formulation can lead to dramatic changes in the crystallization outcome. We demonstrate, using a combination of equilibrium and nonequilibrium computer simulations, that interaction heterogeneity—variations in the energetic interactions among different particle pairs in the population—may favorably impact crystal nucleation. Specifically, interaction heterogeneity is found to lower the free energy barrier to nucleation via the formation of clusters comprised preferentially of strong-binding particle pairs. Moreover, gelation is inhibited by “spreading out over time” the nucleation process, resulting in a reduced density of stable nuclei, allowing each to grow unhindered and larger. Our results suggest a simple and robust approach for enhancing colloidal crystallization near the “sticky sphere” limit, and support the notion that differing extents of interaction heterogeneity arising from various particle functionalization protocols may contribute to the otherwise unexplained variations in crystallization outcomes reported in the literature.

Abstract:
Model cellular membranes are known to form micro- and macroscale lipid domains dependent on molecular composition. The formation of macroscopic lipid domains by lipid mixtures has been the subject of many simulation investigations. We present a critical study of system size impact on lipid domain phase separation into liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered macroscale domains in ternary lipid mixtures. In the popular di-C16:0 PC:di-C18:2 PC:cholesterol at 35:35:30 ratio mixture, we find systems with a minimum of 1480 lipids to be necessary for the formation of macroscopic phase separated domains and systems of 10 000 lipids to achieve structurally converged conformations similar to the thermodynamic limit. To understand these results and predict the behavior of any mixture forming two phases, we develop and investigate an analytical Flory-Huggins model which is recursively validated using simulation and experimental data. We find that micro- and macroscale domains can coexist in ternary mixtures. Additionally, we analyze the distributions of specific lipid-lipid interactions in each phase, characterizing domain structures proposed based on past experimental studies. These findings offer guidance in selecting appropriate system sizes for the study of phase separations and provide new insights into the nature of domain structure for a popular ternary lipid mixture.

Viruses are tremendously efficient molecular devices that optimize the packing of genetic material using a minimalistic number of proteins to form a capsid or envelope that protects them from external threats, being also part of cell recognition, fusion and budding machineries. Progresses in experimental techniques have provided a large number of high-resolution structures of viruses and virus-like particles (VLP), while molecular dynamics simulations may furnish lively and complementary insights on the fundamental forces ruling viral assembly, stability and dynamics. However, the large size and complexity of these macromolecules poses significant computational challenges. Alternatively, Coarse-Grained (CG) methods, which resign atomistic resolution privileging computational efficiency, can be used to characterize the dynamics of VLPs. Still, the massive amount of solvent present in empty capsids or envelopes suggests that hybrid schemes keeping a higher resolution on regions of interest (i.e. the viral proteins and their surroundings) and a progressively coarser description on the bulk may further improve efficiency. Here we introduce a mesoscale explicit water model to be used in double or triple-scale simulations in combination with popular atomistic parameters and the CG water used by the SIRAH force field. Simulations performed on VLPs of different sizes, along with a comprehensive analysis of the PDB, indicate that most of the VLPs so far reported are amenable to be handled on a GPU-accelerated desktop computer using this simulation scheme.

Virtually all biological processes depend on the interaction between proteins at some point. The correct prediction of biomolecular binding free-energies has many interesting applications in both basic and applied pharmaceutical research. While recent advances in the field of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have proven the feasibility of the calculation of protein–protein binding free energies, the large conformational freedom of proteins and complex free energy landscapes of binding processes make such calculations a difficult task. Moreover, convergence and reversibility of resulting free-energy values remain poorly described. In this work, an easy-to-use, yet robust approach for the calculation of standard-state protein–protein binding free energies using perturbed distance restraints is described. In the binding process the conformations of the proteins were restrained, as suggested earlier. Two approaches to avoid end-state problems upon release of the conformational restraints were compared. The method was evaluated by practical application to a small model complex of ubiquitin and the very flexible ubiquitin-binding domain of human DNA polymerase ι (UBM2). All computed free energy differences were closely monitored for convergence, and the calculated binding free energies had a mean unsigned deviation of only 1.4 or 2.5 kJ·mol–1 from experimental values. Statistical error estimates were in the order of thermal noise. We conclude that the presented method has promising potential for broad applicability to quantitatively describe protein–protein and various other kinds of complex formation.

Biomimetic polymer/protein membranes are promising materials for DNA sequencing, sensors, drug delivery and water purification. These self-assembled structures are made from low molecular weight amphiphilic block copolymers (Nhydrophobic < 40 for a diblock copolymer), including poly(ethylene oxide)–1,2-polybutadiene (EO–1,2-BD) and poly(ethylene oxide)–poly(ethyl ethylene) (EO–EE). To examine these membranes' nanoscale structure, we developed a coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG MD) model for EO–1,2-BD and assembled a CG MD model for EO–EE using parameters from two published force fields. We observe that the polymers' hydrophobic core blocks are slightly stretched compared to the random coil configuration seen at higher molecular weights. We also observe an increase in the interdigitation of the hydrophobic leaflets with increasing molecular weight (consistent with literature). The hydration level of the EO corona (which may influence protein incorporation) is higher for membranes with a larger area/chain, regardless of whether EE or 1,2-BD forms the hydrophobic block. Our results provide a molecular-scale view of membrane packing and hydrophobicity, two important properties for creating polymer–protein biomimetic membranes.","Stratified UWHAM and Its Stochastic Approximation for Multicanonical Simulations Which Are Far from Equilibrium

We describe a new analysis tool called Stratified unbinned Weighted Histogram Analysis Method (Stratified-UWHAM), which can be used to compute free energies and expectations from a multicanonical ensemble when a subset of the parallel simulations is far from being equilibrated because of barriers between free energy basins which are only rarely (or never) crossed at some states. The Stratified-UWHAM equations can be obtained in the form of UWHAM equations but with an expanded set of states. We also provide a stochastic solver, Stratified RE-SWHAM, for Stratified-UWHAM to remove its computational bottleneck. Stratified-UWHAM and Stratified RE-SWHAM are applied to study three test topics: the free energy landscape of alanine dipeptide, the binding affinity of a host–guest binding complex, and path sampling for a two-dimensional double well potential. The examples show that when some of the parallel simulations are only locally equilibrated, the estimates of free energies and equilibrium distributions provided by the conventional UWHAM (or MBAR) solutions exhibit considerable biases, but the estimates provided by Stratified-UWHAM and Stratified RE-SWHAM agree with the benchmark very well. Lastly, we discuss features of the Stratified-UWHAM approach which is based on coarse-grainingin relation to two other maximum likelihood-based methods which were proposed recently, that also coarse-grain the multicanonical data.

Abstract:  Advances in experimental and computational techniques allow us to study the structure and dynamics of large biomolecular assemblies at increasingly higher resolution. However, with increasing structural detail it can be challenging to unravel the mechanism underlying the function of molecular machines. One reason is that atomistic simulations become computa- tionally prohibitive. Moreover it is difficult to rationalize the functional mechanism of systems composed of tens of thousands to millions of atoms by following each atom’s movements. Coarse graining (CG) allows us to understand biological structures from a hierarchical per- spective and to gradually zoom into the adequate level of structural detail. This article intro- duces a Bayesian approach for coarse graining biomolecular structures. We develop a probabilistic model that aims to represent the shape of an experimental structure as a cloud of bead particles. The particles interact via a pairwise potential whose parameters are esti- mated along with the bead positions and the CG mapping between atoms and beads. Our model can also be applied to density maps obtained by cryo-electron microscopy. We illus- trate our approach on various test systems.","Piggot, T. J.; Allison, J. R.; Sessions, R. B.; Essex, J.

For molecular dynamics simulations of biological membrane systems to live up to the potential of providing accurate atomic level detail into membrane properties and functions, it is essential that the force fields used to model such systems are as accurate as possible. One membrane property that is often used to assess force field accuracy is the carbon-hydrogen (or carbon-deuterium) order parameters of the lipid tails, which can be accurately measured using experimental NMR techniques. There are a variety of analysis tools available to calculate these order parameters from simulations and it is essential that these computational tools work correctly to ensure the accurate assessment of the simulation force fields. In this work we compare many of these computational tools for calculating the order parameters of POPC membranes. While tools that work on all-atom systems and tools that work on saturated lipid tails in general work extremely well, we demonstrate that the majority of the tested tools that calculate the order parameters for unsaturated united-atom lipid tails do so incorrectly. We identify tools that do perform accurate calculations and include one such program with this work, enabling rapid and accurate calculation of united-atom lipid order parameters. Furthermore, we discuss cases in which it is non-trivial to appropriately predict the unsaturated carbon order parameters in united-atom systems. Finally, we examine order parameter splitting for carbon 2 in sn-2 lipid chains, demonstrating substantial deviations from experimental values in several all-atom and united-atom lipid force fields.

We describe and test theoretical principles for consistent integration of experimental and ab initio data from diverse sources into a single statistical mechanical model. The approach is based on the recently introduced concept of statistical distance between partition functions, uses a simple vector algebra formalism to describe measurement outcomes and coarse-graining operations, and takes advantage of thermodynamic perturbation expressions for fast exploration of the model parameter space. The methodology is demonstrated on a combination of thermodynamic, structural, spectroscopic, and imaging pseudoexperimental data along with ab initio-type trajectories, which are incorporated into models describing the behavior of a near-critical fluid, liquid water, thin-film mixed oxides, and binary alloys. We evaluate how different target data constrain the model parameters and how the uncertainty associated with incomplete target information and limited sampling of the system’s phase space might influence the choice of optimal parameters.",,

Abstract: Many relevant processes in chemistry, physics, and biology are rare events from a computational perspective as they take place beyond the accessible time scale of molecular dynamics (MD). Examples are chemical reactions, nucleation, and conformational changes of biomolecules. Path sampling is an approach to break this time scale limit via a Monte Carlo (MC) sampling of MD trajectories. Still, many trajectories are needed for accurately predicting rate constants. To improve the speed of convergence, we propose two new MC moves, stone skipping and web throwing. In these moves, trajectories are constructed via a sequence of subpaths obeying super-detailed balance. By a reweighting procedure, almost all paths can be accepted. Whereas the generation of a single trajectory becomes more expensive, the reduced correlation results in a significant speedup. For a study on DNA denaturation the increase was found to be a factor 12.
","van der Wel, C.; Heinrich, D.; Kraft, D. J. Microparticle Assembly Pathways on Lipid Membranes. Biophys. J. 2017, 113, 1037–1046.

Understanding interactions between microparticles and lipid membranes is of increasing importance, especially for unraveling the influence of microplastics on our health and environment. Here, we study how a short-ranged adhesive force between microparticles and model lipid membranes causes membrane-mediated particle assembly. Using confocal microscopy, we observe the initial particle attachment to the membrane, then particle wrapping, and in rare cases spontaneous membrane tubulation. In the attached state, we measure that the particle mobility decreases by 26%. If multiple particles adhere to the same vesicle, their initial single-particle state determines their interactions and subsequent assembly pathways: 1) attached particles only aggregate when small adhesive vesicles are present in solution, 2) wrapped particles reversibly attract one another by membrane deformation, and 3) a combination of wrapped and attached particles form membrane-mediated dimers, which further assemble into a variety of complex structures. The experimental observation of distinct assembly pathways, induced only by a short-ranged membrane-particle adhesion, shows that a cytoskeleton or other active components are not required for microparticle aggregation. We suggest that this membrane-mediated microparticle aggregation is a reason behind reported long retention times of polymer microparticles in organisms.

"Surface reconstruction of fluorites in vacuum and aqueous environment; Physical Review Materials 2017, 1.

ABSTRACT: Recent advancement in liquid-environment atomic force microscopy (AFM) has enabled us to visualize three-dimensional (3D) hydration structures as well as two-dimensional (2D) surface structures with subnanometer-scale resolution at solid–water interfaces. However, the influence of ions present in solution on the 2D- and 3D-AFM measurements has not been well understood. In this study, we perform atomic-scale 2D- and 3D-AFM measurements at fluorite–water interfaces in pure water and a supersaturated solution of fluorite. The images obtained in these two environments are compared to understand the influence of the ions in solution on these measurements. In the 2D images, we found clear difference in the nanoscale structures but no significant difference in the atomic-scale contrasts. However, the 3D force images show clear difference in the subnanometer-scale contrasts. The force contrasts measured in pure water largely agree with those expected from the molecular dynamics simulation and the solvent tip approximation model. In the supersaturated solution, an additional force peak is observed over the negatively charged fluorine ion site. This location suggests that the observed force peak may originate from cations adsorbed on the fluorite surface. These results demonstrate that the ions can significantly alter the subnanometer-scale force contrasts in the 3D-AFM images.
","Stress propagation through biological lipid bilayers in silico

J. Am. Chem. Soc., Just Accepted Manuscript. DOI: 10.1021/jacs.7b04724

abstract: Membrane tension plays various critical roles in the cell. We here asked how fast and how far localized pulses of mechanical stress dynamically propagate through biological lipid bilayers. In both coarse-grained and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of a Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine lipid bilayer, we observed nanometer-wide stress pulses, propagating very efficiently longitudinally at a velocity of approximately 1.4±0.5 nm/ps (km/s), in close agreement with the expected speed of sound from experiments. Remarkably, the predicted characteristic attenuation time of the pulses was in the order of tens of picoseconds, implying longitudinal stress propagation over length scales up to several tens of nanometers before damping. Furthermore, the computed dispersion relation leading to such damping was consistent with proposed continuum visco-elastic models of propagation. We suggest this mode of stress propagation as a potential ultra-fast mechanism of signaling which may quickly couple mechanosensitive elements in crowded biological membranes.
","All-Atom Simulations Reveal Protein Charge Decoration in the Folded and Unfolded Ensemble Is Key in Thermophilic Adaptation
Lucas Sawle, Jonathan Huihui, and Kingshuk Ghosh
J. Chem. Theory Comput., 2017, 13 (10), pp 5065–5075
Thermophilic proteins denature at much higher temperature compared to their mesophilic homologues, in spite of high structural and sequential similarity. Computational approaches to understand this puzzle face three major challenges: (i) unfolded ensembles are usually neglected, (ii) simulation studies of the folded states are often too short, and (iii) the majority of investigations focus on a few protein pairs, obscuring the prevalence of different strategies across multiple protein systems. We address these concerns by carrying out all-atom simulations to characterize physicochemical properties of both the folded and the disordered ensemble in multiple (12) thermophilic–mesophilic homologous protein pairs. We notice two clear trends in most pairs (10 out of 12). First, specific distribution of charges in the native basin—sampled from multimicrosecond long Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories—leads to more favorable electrostatic interaction energy in thermophiles compared to mesophiles. Next, thermophilic proteins have lowered electrostatic interaction in their unfolded state—generated using Monte Carlo (MC) simulation—compared to their mesophilic counterparts. The net contribution of interaction energy to folding stability, however, remains more favorable in thermophiles compared to mesophiles. The overall contribution of electrostatics quantified by combining the net interaction energy and the solvation penalty of folding—due to differential charge burial in the folded and the unfolded ensemble—is also mostly favorable in thermophilic proteins compared to mesophiles. The systems that deviate from this trend provide interesting test cases to learn more about alternate design strategies when modification of charges is not viable due to functional reasons. The unequal contribution of the unfolded state to the stability in thermophiles and mesophiles highlights the importance of modeling the disordered ensemble to understand thermophilic adaptation as well as protein stability, in general. Our integrated approach—combining finite element analysis with MC and MD—can be useful in designing charge mutations to alter protein stability.",,"Bin W.

ABSTRACT: Aqueous solution of a fluoride ion at 300 K is studied using the method of ab initio molecular dynamics simulation. Instantaneous fluctuations in vibrational frequencies of local OD stretch modes of deuterated water are calculated using a time-series analysis of the simulated trajectory. The vibrational spectral diffusion of OD modes in the first and second solvation shells and also in bulk of the aqueous fluoride ionic solution are studied through calculations of the frequency time correlation function (FTCF), joint probability distributions, slope of three pulse photon echo (S3PE) and two dimensional infrared spectrum (2D-IR). The vibrational spectral dynamics in the first solvation shell shows decay with three components which can be correlated with the dynamics of intact ion-water hydrogen bonds, ion-water hydrogen bond lifetime and the escape dynamics of water molecules from the solvation shell. The vibrational spectral diffusion of OD modes in the second solvation shell and in the bulk show very similar decay behavior. The timescales obtained from FTCF, S3PE and the slope of nodal line (SNL) of 2D-IR are found to be in reasonable agreement with each others.

abstract: Model cellular membranes are known to form micro- and macroscale lipid domains dependent on molecular composition. The formation of macroscopic lipid domains by lipid mixtures has been the subject of many simulation investigations. We present a critical study of system size impact on lipid domain phase separation into liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered macroscale domains in ternary lipid mixtures. In the popular di-C16:0 PC:di-C18:2 PC:cholesterol at 35:35:30 ratio mixture, we find systems with a minimum of 1480 lipids to be necessary for the formation of macroscopic phase separated domains and systems of 10 000 lipids to achieve structurally converged conformations similar to the thermodynamic limit. To understand these results and predict the behavior of any mixture forming two phases, we develop and investigate an analytical Flory-Huggins model which is recursively validated using simulation and experimental data. We find that micro- and macroscale domains can coexist in ternary mixtures. Additionally, we analyze the distributions of specific lipid- lipid interactions in each phase, characterizing domain structures proposed based on past experimental studies. These findings offer guidance in selecting appropriate system sizes for the study of phase separations and provide new insights into the nature of domain structure for a popular ternary lipid mixture

ABSTRACT: Finding the optimal alignment between two structures is important for identifying the minimum root-mean-square distance (RMSD) between them and as a starting point for calculating pathways. Most current algorithms for aligning structures are stochastic, scale exponentially with the size of structure, and the performance can be unreliable. We present two complementary methods for aligning structures corresponding to isolated clusters of atoms and to condensed matter described by a periodic cubic supercell. The first method (Go-PERMDIST), a branch and bound algorithm, locates the global minimum RMSD deterministically in polynomial time. The run time increases for larger RMSDs. The second method (FASTOVERLAP) is a heuristic algorithm that aligns structures by finding the global maximum kernel correlation between them using fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) and fast SO(3) transforms (SOFTs). For periodic systems FASTOVERLAP scales with the square of the number of identical atoms in the system, reliably finds the best alignment between structures that are not too distant, and shows significantly better performance than existing algorithms. The expected run time for Go-PERMDIST is larger than FASTOVERLAP for periodic systems. For finite clusters, the FASTOVERLAP algorithm is competitive with existing algorithms. The expected run time for Go-PERMDIST to find the global RMSD between two structures deterministically is generally longer than for existing stochastic algorithms. However, with an earlier exit condition, Go-PERMDIST exhibits similar or better performance.
","Ultrasensitivity of Water Exchange Kinetics to the Size of Metal Ion

Yuno Lee, D. Thirumalai, and Changbong Hyeon

J. Am. Chem. Soc., Article ASAP. DOI: 10.1021/jacs.7b04198

abstract: Metal ions play a vital role in many biological processes. An important factor in these processes is the dynamics of exchange between ion bound-water molecules and the bulk. Although structural and dynamical properties of labile waters bound to metal ions, such as Na+ and Ca2+, can be elucidated using molecular dynamics simulations, direct evaluation of rates of exchange of waters rigidly bound to high charge density Mg2+, has been elusive. Here, we report a universal relationship, allowing us to determine the water exchange time on metal ions as a function of valence and hydration radius. The proposed relationship, which covers times spanning 14 orders of magnitude, highlights the ultrasensitivity of water lifetime to the ion size, as exemplified by divalent ions, Ca2+ (∼100 ps) and Mg2+ (∼1.5 μs). We show that even when structures, characterized by radial distributions are similar, a small difference in hydration radius leads to a qualitatively different (associative or dissociative) mechanism of water exchange. Our work provides a theoretical basis for determination of hydration radius, which is critical for accurately modeling the water dynamics around multivalent ions, and hence in describing all electrostatically driven events such as ribozyme folding and catalysis.",,,

doi:10.1073/pnas.1705624114
The M2 proton channel of influenza A is a drug target that is essential for the reproduction of the flu virus. It is also a model system for the study of selective, unidirectional proton transport across a membrane. Ordered water molecules arranged in “wires” inside the channel pore have been proposed to play a role in both the conduction of protons to the four gating His37 residues and the stabilization of multiple positive charges within the channel. To visualize the solvent in the pore of the channel at room temperature while minimizing the effects of radiation damage, data were collected to a resolution of 1.4 Å using an X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) at three different pH conditions: pH 5.5, pH 6.5, and pH 8.0. Data were collected on the Inwardopenstate, which is an intermediate that accumulates at high protonation of the His37 tetrad. At pH 5.5, a continuous hydrogen-bonded network of water molecules spans the vertical length of the channel, consistent with a Grotthuss mechanism model for proton transport to the His37 tetrad. This ordered solvent at pH 5.5 could act to stabilize the positive charges that build up on the gating His37 tetrad during the proton conduction cycle. The number of ordered pore waters decreases at pH 6.5 and 8.0, where the Inwardopen state is less stable. These studies provide a graphical view of the response of water to a change in charge within a restricted channel environment.","A multi-state coarse grained modeling approach for an intrinsically disordered peptide
 Ramezanghorbani, Farhad Dalgicdir, Cahit Dalgicdir, Cahit The Journal of Chemical Physics 2017 147 9 doi: 10.1063/1.5001087

Many proteins display a marginally stable tertiary structure, which can be altered via external stimuli. Since a majority of coarse grained (CG) models are aimed at structure prediction, their success for an intrinsically disordered peptide’s conformational space with marginal stability and sensitivity to external stimuli cannot be taken for granted. In this study, by using the LKαα14 peptide as a test system, we demonstrate a bottom-up approach for constructing a multi-state CG model, which can capture the conformational behavior of this peptide in three distinct environments with a unique set of interaction parameters. LKαα14 is disordered in dilute solutions; however, it strictly adopts the αα-helix conformation upon aggregation or when in contact with a hydrophobic/hydrophilic interface. Our bottom-up approach combines a generic base model, that is unbiased for any particular secondary structure, with nonbonded interactions which represent hydrogen bonds, electrostatics, and hydrophobic forces. We demonstrate that by using carefully designed all atom potential of mean force calculations from all three states of interest, one can get a balanced representation of the nonbonded interactions. Our CG model behaves intrinsically disordered in bulk water, folds into an αα-helix in the presence of an interface or a neighboring peptide, and is stable as a tetrameric unit, successfully reproducing the all atom molecular dynamics simulations and experimental results.
",,,"We describe a new analysis tool called Stratified unbinned Weighted Histogram Analysis Method (Stratified-UWHAM), which can be used to compute free energies and expectations from a multicanonical ensemble when a subset of the parallel simulations is far from being equilibrated because of barriers between free energy basins which are only rarely (or never) crossed at some states. The Stratified-UWHAM equations can be obtained in the form of UWHAM equations but with an expanded set of states. We also provide a stochastic solver, Stratified RE-SWHAM, for Stratified-UWHAM to remove its computational bottleneck. Stratified-UWHAM and Stratified RE-SWHAM are applied to study three test topics: the free energy landscape of alanine dipeptide, the binding affinity of a host–guest binding complex, and path sampling for a two-dimensional double well potential. The examples show that when some of the parallel simulations are only locally equilibrated, the estimates of free energies and equilibrium distributions provided by the conventional UWHAM (or MBAR) solutions exhibit considerable biases, but the estimates provided by Stratified-UWHAM and Stratified RE-SWHAM agree with the benchmark very well. Lastly, we discuss features of the Stratified-UWHAM approach which is based on coarse-grainingin relation to two other maximum likelihood-based methods which were proposed recently, that also coarse-grain the multicanonical data."
"Restrained Proton Indicator in Combined Quantum-Mechanics/Molecular-Mechanics Dynamics Simulations of Proton Transfer through a Carbon Nanotube

The Journal of Physical Chemistry B Article ASAP
DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b06657
Recently, a collective variable “proton indicator” was purposed for tracking an excess proton solvated in bulk water in molecular dynamics simulations. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing the position of this proton indicator as a reaction coordinate to model an excess proton migrating through a hydrophobic carbon nanotube in combined quantum-mechanics/molecular-mechanics simulations. Our results indicate that applying a harmonic restraint to the proton indicator in the bulk solvent near the nanotube pore entrance leads to the recruitment of water molecules into the pore. This is consistent with an earlier study that employed a multistate empirical valence bond potential and a different representation (center of excess charge) of the proton. We attribute this water recruitment to the delocalized nature of the solvated proton, which prefers to be in high-dielectric bulk solvent. While water recruitment into the pore is considered an artifact in the present simulations (because of the artificially imposed restraint on the proton), if the proton were naturally restrained, it could assist in building water wires prior to proton transfer through the pore. The potential of mean force for a proton translocation through the water-filled pore was computed by umbrella sampling, where the bias potentials were applied to the proton indicator. The free energy curve and barrier heights agree reasonably with those in the literature. The results suggest that the proton indicator can be used as a reaction coordinate in simulations of proton transport in confined environments.

"Quantum mechanical free energy profiles with post-quantization restraints: Binding free energy of the water dimer over a broad range of temperatures
 Kevin P. Bishop and Pierre-Nicholas Roy
The Journal of Chemical Physics 2018 148:10 
Free energy calculations are a crucial part of understanding chemical systems but are often computationally expensive for all but the simplest of systems. Various enhanced sampling techniques have been developed to improve the efficiency of these calculations in numerical simulations. However, the majority of these approaches have been applied using classical molecular dynamics. There are many situations where nuclear quantum effects impact the system of interest and a classical description fails to capture these details. In this work, path integral molecular dynamics has been used in conjunction with umbrella sampling, and it has been observed that correct results are only obtained when the umbrella sampling potential is applied to a single path integral bead post quantization. This method has been validated against a Lennard-Jones benchmark system before being applied to the more complicated water dimer system over a broad range of temperatures. Free energy profiles are obtained, and these are utilized in the calculation of the second virial coefficient as well as the change in free energy from the separated water monomers to the dimer. Comparisons to experimental and ground state calculation values from the literature are made for the second virial coefficient at higher temperature and the dissociation energy of the dimer in the ground state.

We present a computational multiscale study of a metal-organic framework (MOF)/polymer composite combining micro- and mesoscopic resolution, by coupling atomistic and coarse grained (CG) force field-based molecular dynamics simulations. As a proof of concept, we describe the Copper paddlewheel-based HKUST-1 MOF/Poly(vinyl alcohol) composite. Our newly developed CG model reproduces the salient features of the interface in excellent agreement with the atomistic model and allows the investigation of substantially larger systems. The polymer penetrates into the open pores of the MOF as a result of the interactions between its OH groups and the O and Cu atoms in the pores, suggesting an excellent MOF/polymer compatibility. Polymer structure is affected by the MOF surface up to a distance of ~ 2.4 times its radius of gyration. This study paves the way towards understanding important interfacial phenomena such as aggregation and phase separation in these mixed matrix systems.

"Title: Elastic network model of learned maintained contacts to predict protein motion

Authors: Ines Putz and Oliver Brock

Abstract: We present a novel elastic network model, lmcENM, to determine protein motion even for localized functional motions that involve substantial changes in the protein’s contact topology. Existing elastic network models assume that the contact topology remains unchanged throughout the motion and are thus most appropriate to simulate highly collective function related movements. lmcENM uses machine learning to differentiate breaking from maintained contacts. We show that lmcENM accurately captures functional transitions unexplained by the classical ENM and three reference ENM variants, while preserving the simplicity of classical ENM. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a large set of proteins covering different motion types. Our results suggest that accurately predicting a “deformation-invariant” contact topology offers a promising route to increase the general applicability of ENMs. We also find that to correctly predict this contact topology a combination of several features seems to be relevant which may vary slightly depending on the protein. Additionally, we present case studies of two biologically interesting systems, Ferric Citrate membrane transporter FecA and Arachidonate 15-Lipoxygenase.

Transmembrane self-assembling cyclic peptide (SCP) nanotubes are promising candidates for delivering specific molecules through cell membranes. The detailed mechanisms behind the transmembrane processes, as well as stabilization factors of transmembrane structures, are difficult to elucidate through experiments. In this study, the effects of peptide sequence and oligomeric state on the transmembrane capabilities of SCP nanotubes and the perturbation of embedded SCP nanotubes acting on the membrane were investigated based on coarse grained molecular dynamics simulation. The simulation results reveal that hydrophilic SCP oligomers result in the elevation of the energy barrier while the oligomerization of hydrophobic SCPs causes the reduction of the energy barrier, further leading to membrane insertion. Once SCP nanotubes are embedded, membrane properties such as density, thickness, ordering state and lateral mobility are adjusted along the radial direction. This study provides insight into the transmembrane strategy of SCP nanotubes and sheds light on designing novel transport systems.",,,

Abstract: Vinculin is an actin-binding protein thought to reinforce cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions. However, how mechanical load affects the vinculin–F-actin bond is unclear. Using a single-molecule optical trap assay, we found that vinculin forms a force-dependent catch bond with F-actin through its tail domain, but with lifetimes that depend strongly on the direction of the applied force. Force toward the pointed (–) end of the actin filament resulted in a bond that was maximally stable at 8 piconewtons, with a mean lifetime (12 seconds) 10 times as long as the mean lifetime when force was applied toward the barbed (+) end. A computational model of lamellipodial actin dynamics suggests that the directionality of the vinculin–F-actin bond could establish long-range order in the actin cytoskeleton. The directional and force-stabilized binding of vinculin to F-actin may be a mechanism by which adhesion complexes maintain front-rear asymmetry in migrating cells.

The hydrophilic phosphate moiety in the headgroup of phospholipids
forms strong hydrogen bonds with water molecules in the first hydration layer. Timedomain
terahertz spectroscopy in a range from 100 to 1000 cm−1 reveals the influence of
such interactions on rotations of water molecules. We determine librational absorption

waters per phospholipid molecule. A pronounced absorption feature with maximum at 830
cm−1 is superimposed on a broad absorption band between 300 and 1000 cm−1. Molecular
dynamics simulations of water in the reverse micelles suggest that the feature at 830 cm−1
arises from water molecules forming one or two strong hydrogen bonds with phosphate
groups, while the broad component comes from bulk-like environments. This behavior is
markedly different from water interacting with less polar surfaces.

"Title: Diffusion of Integral Membrane Proteins in Protein-Rich Membranes

Authors: Matti Javanainen, Hector Martinez-Seara, Ralf Metzler, and Ilpo Vattulainen

Abstract: The lateral diffusion of embedded proteins along lipid membranes in protein-poor conditions has been successfully described in terms of the Saffman–Delbrück (SD) model, which predicts that the protein diffusion coefficient D is weakly dependent on its radius R as D ∝ ln(1/R). However, instead of being protein-poor, native cell membranes are extremely crowded with proteins. On the basis of extensive molecular simulations, we here demonstrate that protein crowding of the membrane at physiological levels leads to deviations from the SD relation and to the emergence of a stronger Stokes-like dependence D ∝ 1/R. We propose that this 1/R law mainly arises due to geometrical factors: smaller proteins are able to avoid confinement effects much better than their larger counterparts. The results highlight that the lateral dynamics in the crowded setting found in native membranes is radically different from protein-poor conditions and plays a significant role in formation of functional multiprotein complexes.

Biological membranes are essential for cell life and hydration. Water provides the driving force for the
assembly and stability of many cell components. Here, we study the structural properties of water in a
phospholipid membrane. We characterize the local structures, inspecting the intermediate range order
(IRO) and adopting a sensitive local order metric recently proposed by Martelli et al. that measures
and grades the degree of overlap of the local environment with the structures of perfect ice. Close to
the membrane, water acquires a high IRO and changes its dynamical properties; i.e., its translational
and rotational degrees of freedom slow in a region that extends over ≃ 1 nm from the membrane
interface. Surprisingly, we show that at distances as far as ≃ 2:5 nm from the interface, although the
bulk-like dynamics are recovered, the IRO of water is still slightly higher than that in the bulk under
the same thermodynamic conditions. Therefore, the water-membrane interface has a structural effect
at ambient conditions that propagates further than the often-invoked 1-nm length scale. Consequently,
this should be considered when analyzing experimental data of water confined by membranes and could
help us to understand the role of water in biological systems.",,,

magnitude slower than that of the free water; and (3) tightly bound
water, whose dynamical behavior is comparable with that of DMPC

Abstract Perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) polymer membranes are widely used as proton exchange membranes. Because the structure of the aqueous domain within the PFSA membrane is expected to directly influence proton conductance, many coarse-grained (CG) simulation studies have been performed to investigate the membrane morphology; these studies mostly used phenomenological models, such as dissipative particle dynamics. However, a chemically accurate CG model is required to investigate the morphology in realistic membranes and to provide a concrete molecular design. Here, we attempt to construct a predictive CG model for the structure and morphology of PFSA membranes that is compatible with the Sinoda-DeVane-Klein (SDK) CG water model [Shinoda et al., Mol. Simul. 33, 27 (2007)]. First, we extended the parameter set for the SDK CG force field to examine a hydrated PFSA membrane based on thermodynamic and structural data from experiments and all-atom (AA) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. However, a noticeable degradation of the morphology motivated us to improve the structural properties by using the iterative Boltzmann inversion (IBI) approach. Thus, we explored a possible combination of the SDK and IBI approaches to describe the nonbonded interaction. The hybrid SDK/IBI model improved the structural issues of SDK, showing a better agreement with AA-MD in the radial distribution functions. The hybrid SDK/IBI model was determined to reasonably reproduce both the thermodynamic and structural properties of the PFSA membrane for all examined water contents. In addition, the model demonstrated good transferability and has considerable potential for application to realistic long-chained PFSA membranes.",,,

Abstract Transmembrane self-assembling cyclic peptide (SCP) nanotubes are promising candidates for delivering specific molecules through cell membranes. The detailed mechanisms behind the transmembrane processes, as well as stabilization factors of transmembrane structures, are difficult to elucidate through experiments. In this study, the effects of peptide sequence and oligomeric state on the transmembrane capabilities of SCP nanotubes and the perturbation of embedded SCP nanotubes acting on the membrane were investigated based on coarse grained molecular dynamics simulation. The simulation results reveal that hydrophilic SCP oligomers result in the elevation of the energy barrier while the oligomerization of hydrophobic SCPs causes the reduction of the energy barrier, further leading to membrane insertion. Once SCP nanotubes are embedded, membrane properties such as density, thickness, ordering state and lateral mobility are adjusted along the radial direction. This study provides insight into the transmembrane strategy of SCP nanotubes and sheds light on designing novel transport systems.",,,

Abstract Viruses are tremendously efficient molecular devices that optimize the packing of genetic material using a minimalistic number of proteins to form a capsid or envelope that protects them from external threats, being also part of cell recognition, fusion and budding machineries. Progresses in experimental techniques have provided a large number of high-resolution structures of viruses and virus-like particles (VLP), while molecular dynamics simulations may furnish lively and complementary insights on the fundamental forces ruling viral assembly, stability and dynamics. However, the large size and complexity of these macromolecules poses significant computational challenges. Alternatively, Coarse-Grained (CG) methods, which resign atomistic resolution privileging computational efficiency, can be used to characterize the dynamics of VLPs. Still, the massive amount of solvent present in empty capsids or envelopes suggests that hybrid schemes keeping a higher resolution on regions of interest (i.e. the viral proteins and their surroundings) and a progressively coarser description on the bulk may further improve efficiency. Here we introduce a mesoscale explicit water model to be used in double or triple-scale simulations in combination with popular atomistic parameters and the CG water used by the SIRAH force field. Simulations performed on VLPs of different sizes, along with a comprehensive analysis of the PDB, indicate that most of the VLPs so far reported are amenable to be handled on a GPU-accelerated desktop computer using this simulation scheme.

Abstract Model cellular membranes are known to form micro- and macroscale lipid domains dependent on molecular composition. The formation of macroscopic lipid domains by lipid mixtures has been the subject of many simulation investigations. We present a critical study of system size impact on lipid domain phase separation into liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered macroscale domains in ternary lipid mixtures. In the popular di-C16:0 PC:di-C18:2 PC:cholesterol at 35:35:30 ratio mixture, we find systems with a minimum of 1480 lipids to be necessary for the formation of macroscopic phase separated domains and systems of 10 000 lipids to achieve structurally converged conformations similar to the thermodynamic limit. To understand these results and predict the behavior of any mixture forming two phases, we develop and investigate an analytical Flory-Huggins model which is recursively validated using simulation and experimental data. We find that micro- and macroscale domains can coexist in ternary mixtures. Additionally, we analyze the distributions of specific lipid-lipid interactions in each phase, characterizing domain structures proposed based on past experimental studies. These findings offer guidance in selecting appropriate system sizes for the study of phase separations and provide new insights into the nature of domain structure for a popular ternary lipid mixture.

Abstract Water dynamics in concentrated ionic solutions plays an important role in a number of material and energy conversion processes such as the charge transfer at the electrolyte–electrode interface in aqueous rechargeable ion batteries. One long-standing puzzle is that all electrolytes, regardless of their “structure-making/breaking” nature, make water rotate slower at high concentrations. To understand this effect, we present a theoretical simulation study of the reorientational motion of water molecules in different ionic solutions. Using an extended Ivanov model, water rotation is decomposed into contributions from large-amplitude angular jumps and a slower frame motion which was studied in a coarse-grained manner. Bearing a certain resemblance to water rotation near large biological molecules, the general deceleration is found to be largely due to the coupling of the slow, collective component of water rotation with the motion of large hydrated ion clusters ubiquitously existing in the concentrated ionic solutions. This finding is at variance with the intuitive expectation that the slowing down is caused by the change in fast, singlemolecular water hydrogen bond switching adjacent to the ions.

doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4986079
While quantum chemical simulations have been increasingly used as an invaluable source of information for atomistic model development, the high computational expenses typically associated with these techniques often limit thorough sampling of the systems of interest. It is therefore of great practical importance to use all available information as efficiently as possible, and in a way that allows for consistent addition of constraints that may be provided by macroscopic experiments. Here we propose a simple approach that combines information from configurational energies and forces generated in a molecular dynamics simulation to increase the effective number of samples. Subsequently, this information is used to optimize a molecular force field by minimizing the statistical distance similarity metric. We illustrate the methodology on an example of a trajectory of configurations generated in equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of argon and water and compare the results with those based on the force matching method.
","Nanoconfinement in Slit Pores Enhances Water Self-Dissociation

Daniel Muñoz-Santiburcio and Dominik Marx

We investigate the self-dissociation of water that is nanoconfined between the sheets of a realistic layered mineral, FeS mackinawite, as well as between Lennard-Jones walls via ab initio simulations. By comparing it with the same reaction in bulk water under various thermodynamic conditions, we show that such strong two-dimensional confinement between hard surfaces greatly enhances the self-dissociation process of water—thus increasing its ionic product Kw due to nanoconfinement. In addition to providing free energies, we analyze in detail the underlying dielectric properties in terms of dipole moment distributions, and thus the polarity of the liquid, as well as local polarization fluctuations as quantified by dielectric tensor profiles perpendicular to the lamella.
","R. Satija, A. Das and D. E. Makarov, Transition path times reveal memory effects and anomalous diffusion in the dynamics of protein folding, J. Chem. Phys., 147, 152707 (2017)

Abstract: 
Recent single-molecule experiments probed transition paths of biomolecular folding and, in partic- ular, measured the time biomolecules spend while crossing their free energy barriers. A surprising finding from these studies is that the transition barriers crossed by transition paths, as inferred from experimentally observed transition path times, are often lower than the independently determined free energy barriers. Here we explore memory effects leading to anomalous diffusion as a possi- ble origin of this discrepancy. Our analysis of several molecular dynamics trajectories shows that the dynamics of common reaction coordinates used to describe protein folding is subdiffusive, at least at sufficiently short times. We capture this effect using a one-dimensional fractional Brownian motion (FBM) model, in which the system undergoes a subdiffusive process in the presence of a potential of mean force, and show that this model yields much broader distributions of transition path times with stretched exponential long-time tails. Without any adjustable parameters, these dis- tributions agree well with the transition path times computed directly from protein trajectories. We further discuss how the FBM model can be tested experimentally.

Molecular dynamics simulations have valuably complemented experiments describing the dynamics of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), particularly since the proposal of models to solve the artificial collapse of IDPs in silico. Such models suggest redefining non-bonded interactions, by either increasing water dispersion forces or adopting the Kirkwood-Buff force field. These approaches yield extended conformers that better comply with experiments, but it is unclear if they all sample the same intra-chain dynamics of IDPs. We have tested this by employing MD simulations and smFRET spectroscopy to sample the dimensions of systems with different sequence compositions: namely strong and weak polyelectrolytes. For strong polyelectrolytes in which charge effects dominate, all the proposed solutions equally reproduce the expected ensemble’s dimensions. For weak polyelectrolytes, at lower cutoffs, force fields abnormally alter intra-chain dynamics, overestimating excluded volume over chain flexibility or reporting no difference between the dynamics of different chains. The TIP4PD water model alone can reproduce experimentally observed changes in extensions (dimensions), but not quantitatively and with only weak statistical significance. Force field limitations are reversed with increased interaction cutoffs, showing that chain dynamics are critically defined by the presence of long-range interactions. Force field analysis aside, our study provides the first insights into how long-range interactions critically define IDP dimensions and raises the question of which length range is crucial to correctly sample the overall dimensions and internal dynamics of the large group of weakly charged yet highly polar IDPs.",

Protonic arrangements were detected in water bridge structures using confocal Raman microscopy, and the spectra show two formed structures. The measured Raman spectra were modified using the voltage applied to the bridge structure, which changed the proportion of these two species. Initially, for a 6.3 kV applied voltage, there was a measurable increase in the bridge current above the Ohmic contribution and the observed Raman spectrum of this new injected specie corresponded to the computed spectrum for the Zundel protonic arrangement. As the voltage further increases a contribution from the Eigen proton solvation specie is added to the measured spectrum.

Abstract: Typical experimental setups for molecular systems must deal with a certain coupling to the external environment, that is, the system is open and exchanges mass, momentum, and energy with its surroundings. Instead, standard molecular simulations are mostly performed using periodic boundary conditions with a constant number of molecules. In this review, we summarize major development of simulation methodologies, which, contrary to standard techniques, open up the boundaries of a molecular system and allow for exchange of energy and matter with the environment, in and out of equilibrium. In particular, we construct the review around the open boundary simulation approaches based on the Adaptive Resolution Scheme (AdResS), which seamlessly couples different levels of resolution in molecular simulations. Ideas and theoretical concepts used in its development lie at the crossroad of different fields and disciplines and open many different directions for future developments in molecular simulation. We examine progress related to theoretical as well as novel modeling approaches bridging length scales from quantum to the continuum description and report on their application in various molecular systems. The outlook of the review is dedicated to the perspective of how to further incorporate rigorous theoretical approaches such as the Bergmann–Lebowitz and Emch–Sewell models into the molecular simulation algorithms and stimulate further development of open boundary simulation methods and their application.

Dynamin is a mechanochemical GTPase essential for membrane fission during clathrin mediated endocytosis. Dynamin forms washer ring-shaped/helical complexes at the neck of clathrin-coated pits and their structural changes coupled with GTP hydrolysis drive membrane fission. Dynamin and its binding protein amphiphysin cooperatively regulates membrane remodeling during fission, but its precise mechanism remains elusive. In this study, we analyze structural changes of dynamin-amphiphysin complexes during membrane fission using electron microscopy (EM) and high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM). Interestingly, HS-AFM analyses show that the dynamin-amphiphysin rings are rearranged to form clusters upon GTP hydrolysis and membrane constriction occurs at protein-uncoated regions flanking the clusters. We also show a novel function of amphiphysin in size control of the clusters to enhance biogenesis of endocytic vesicles. Our new approaches using combination of EM and HS-AFM clearly demonstrates dynamics of dynamin-amphiphysin complexes during membrane fission suggesting a novel {\textquotedblleft}clusterase{\textquotedblright} model of dynamin-mediated membrane fission.

Stable membrane orientations of small dual-topology membrane proteins

doi:10.1073/pnas.1706905114 
The orientations of multispanning membrane proteins in the membrane are initially determined when they are cotranslationally inserted into the membrane. However, it is not always clear whether these initial orientations may be dynamic after the insertion step or not. The present study shows that even in the case of small membrane proteins that have only four transmembrane helices and have little bias to be inserted in one or the other orientation, the initially inserted orientation remains stable and is not dynamic, at least with respect to the orientation of the entire protein. This finding suggests that membrane proteins become correctly oriented already during or immediately after synthesis, as they are inserted into the membrane.","Why enveloped viruses need cores–the contribution of a nucleocapsid core to viral budding

GR Lázaro, S Mukhopadhyay, MF Hagan

arXiv:1706.04867v2

During the alphavirus lifecycle, a nucleocapsid core buds through the cell membrane to acquire an outer en- velope of lipid membrane and viral glycoproteins. However, the presence of a nucleocapsid core is not required for assembly of infectious particles. To determine the role of the nucleocapsid core, we develop a coarse-grained computational model with which we investigate budding dynamics as a function of glycoprotein and nucleocap- sid interactions, as well as budding in the absence of a nucleocapsid. We find that there is a transition between glycoprotein-directed budding and nucleocapsid-directed budding which occurs above a threshold strength of nucleocapsid interactions. The simulations predict that glycoprotein-directed budding leads to significantly in- creased size polydispersity and particle polymorphism. This polydispersity can be qualitatively explained by a theoretical model accounting for the competition between bending energy of the membrane and the glyco- protein shell. The simulations also show that the geometry of a budding particle leads to a barrier to subunit diffusion, which can result in a stalled, partially budded state. We present a phase diagram for this and other morphologies of budded particles. Comparison of these structures against experiments could establish bounds on whether budding is directed by glycoprotein or nucleocapsid interactions. Although our model is motivated by alphaviruses, we discuss implications of our results for other enveloped viruses."," S. Chowdhury and P. Huo, Coherent State Mapping Ring-Polymer Molecular Dynamics for Non-Adiabatic Quantum Propagations, arXiv: 1706.08403v2



Abstract:We introduce the coherent state mapping ring-polymer molecular dynamics (CS-RPMD), a new method that accurately describes electronic non-adiabatic dynamics with explicit nuclear quantization. This new approach is derived by using coherent state mapping representation for the electronic degrees of freedom (DOF) and the ring-polymer path-integral representation for the nuclear DOF. CS-RPMD Hamiltonian does not contain any inter-bead coupling term in the state-dependent potential, which is a key feature that ensures correct electronic Rabi oscillations. Hamilton’s equation of motion is used to sample initial configurations and propagate the trajectories, preserving the distribution with classical evolution. In the special one-bead limit for mapping variables, CS-RPMD preserves the detailed balance. Numerical tests of this method with a two-state model system show a very good agreement with exact quantum results over a broad range of electronic couplings.

Aggregation of alpha synuclein has strong implications in Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease. The heterogeneity of folding/aggregation landscape and transient nature of the early intermediates result in difficulty in developing a successful therapeutic intervention. Here we used fluorescence measurements at ensemble and single molecule resolution to study how the late and early events of alpha synuclein aggregation modulate each other. The in-vitro aggregation data was complemented using measurements inside live neuroblastoma cells by employing a small molecule labeling technique. An inhibitor molecule (arginine), which delayed the late event of amyloidosis, was found to bind to the protein, shifting the early conformational fluctuations towards a compact state. In contrast, a facilitator of late aggregation (glutamate), was found to be excluded from the protein surface. The presence of glutamate was found to speed up the oligomer formation at the early stage. We found that the effects of the inhibitor and facilitator were additive and as a result they maintained a ratio at which they cancelled each other{\textquoteright}s influence on different stages of alpha synuclein aggregation.

ABSTRACT: A detailed understanding of the drug-receptor association process is of fundamental importance for drug design. Due to the long timescales of typical binding kinetics, the atomistic simulation of the ligand traveling from bulk solution into the binding site is still computationally challenging. In this work, we apply a multi-scale approach of combined molecular dynamics (MD) and Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations to investigate association pathway ensembles for the two prominent H1N1 neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir. Including knowledge of the approximate binding site location allows for the selective confinement of detailed but expensive MD simulations and application of less demanding BD simulations for the diffusion controlled part of the association pathway. We evaluate a binding criterion based on the residence time of the inhibitor in the binding pocket and compare it to geometric criteria that require prior knowledge about the binding mechanism. The method ranks the association rates of both inhibitors in qualitative agreement with experiment and yields reasonable absolute values depending, however, on the reaction criteria. The simulated association pathway ensembles reveal that, first, ligands are oriented in the electrostatic field of the receptor. Subsequently, a salt bridge is formed between the inhibitor's carboxyl group and neuraminidase residue Arg368, followed by adopting the native binding mode. Unexpectedly, despite oseltamivir's higher overall association rate, the rate into the intermediate salt-bridge state was found to be higher for zanamivir. The present methodology is intrinsically parallelizable and although computationally demanding allows systematic binding rate calculation on selected sets of potential drug molecules.","Sun, Y.; Leong, N.

Actin-related protein 2/3 (Arp2/3) complex activation by nucleation promoting factors (NPFs) such as WASP, plays an important role in many actin-mediated cellular processes. In yeast, Arp2/3-mediated actin filament assembly drives endocytic membrane invagination and vesicle scission. Here we used genetics and quantitative live-cell imaging to probe the mechanisms that concentrate NPFs at endocytic sites, and to investigate how NPFs regulate actin assembly onset. Our results demonstrate that SH3 (Src homology 3) domain-PRM (proline-rich motif) interactions involving multivalent linker proteins play central roles in concentrating NPFs at endocytic sites. Quantitative imaging suggested that productive actin assembly initiation is tightly coupled to accumulation of threshold levels of WASP and WIP, but not to recruitment kinetics or release of autoinhibition. These studies provide evidence that WASP and WIP play central roles in establishment of a robust multivalent SH3 domain-PRM network in vivo, giving actin assembly onset at endocytic sites a switch-like behavior.",

ABSTRACT: In this article, a user-friendly Gaussian biased accelerated molecular dynamics (GbAMD) method is presented that uses a sum of Gaussians of potential energies as the biased force to accelerate the conformational sampling. The easy parameter setting of GbAMD is demonstrated in a variety of simulation tests for the conformational transitions of proteins with various complexity including the folding of Trpcage, GB1p, and HP35 peptides as well as the functional conformational changes of nCaM and HIV-1 PR proteins. Additionally, the ability of GbAMD in conformational sampling and free-energy evaluation is quantitatively assessed through the comparison of GbAMD simulations on the folding of α-helical Trpcage and β-hairpin GB1p with the accompanying standard dual boost AMD and conventional MD (cMD) simulations. While GbAMD can fold both peptides into their native structures repeatedly in individual trajectories, AMD can only fold Trpcage and cMD fails the folding in both cases. As a result, only GbAMD can quantitatively measure the properties of the equilibrium conformational ensemble of protein folding consistent with experimental data. Also notable is that the structural properties of the indispensable unfolded and transition states in the folding pathways of Trpcage and GB1p characterized by GbAMD simulations are in great agreement with previous simulations on the two peptides. In summary, GbAMD has an effective conformational sampling ability that provides a convenient and effective access for simulating the structural dynamics of biomolecular systems.","Coarse graining from variationally enhanced sampling applied to the Ginzburg–Landau model

from atomistic simulations, providing thus a direct connection
between the microscopic and the mesoscopic scale. The coarsegrained
model we consider is that of Ginzburg–Landau, valid
around a second-order critical point. In particular, we use it to
describe a Lennard–Jones fluid in the region close to the liquid–
vapor critical point. The procedure is general and can be adapted

ABSTRACT: The rapid spreading of antimicrobial resistance in Gram-negative bacteria has become a major threat for humans as well as animals. As one of the main factors involved, the permeability of the outer membrane has attracted quite some attention recently. However, the knowledge regarding the translocation mechanisms for most available antibiotics is so far rather limited. Here, a theoretical study concerning the diffusion route of ciprofloxacin across the outer membrane porin OmpC from E. coli is presented. To this end, we establish a protocol to characterize meaningful permeation pathways by combining metadynamics with the zero-temperature string method. It was found that the lowest-energy pathway requires a reorientation of ciprofloxacin in the extracellular side of the porin before reaching the constriction region with its carboxyl group ahead. Several affinity sites have been identified and their metastability evaluated using unbiased simulations. Such a detailed understanding is potentially very helpful in guiding the development of next generation antibiotics.

 ","Dynamical Behavior of Hydration Water Molecules between Phospholipid Membranes

The dynamical behavior of hydration water sandwiched between 1,2-dimyristyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) bilayers was investigated by quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) in the range between 275 and 316 K, where the main transition temperature of DMPC is interposed. The results revealed that the hydration water could be categorized into three types of water: (1) free water, whose dynamical behavior is slightly different from that of bulk water; (2) loosely bound water, whose dynamical behavior is 1 order of magnitude slower than that of the free water; and (3) tightly bound water, whose dynamical behavior is comparable with that of DMPC molecules. The number of loosely bound and tightly bound water molecules per DMPC molecule monotonically decreased and increased with decreasing temperature, respectively, and the sum of these water molecules remained constant. The number of free water molecules per DMPC molecule was constant in the measured temperature range.

ABSTRACT: We present the implementation of a Born-Oppenheimer (BO) hybrid Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics (QM/MM) Molecular Dynamics (MD) strategy using Density Functional Theory (DFT) and the polarizable AMOEBA force field. This approach couples the Gaussian and Tinker suite of programs through a variational formalism allowing for a full self-consistent relaxation of both the AMOEBA induced dipoles and the DFT electronic density at each MD step. As the DFT SCF cycles are the limiting factor in terms of computational efforts and MD stability, we focus on the latter aspect and compare the Time-Reversible BO (TR– BO) and the Extended BO Lagrangian approaches (XL–BO) to the MD propagation. The XL–BO approach allows for stable, energy-conserving trajectories offering various perspectives for hybrid simulations using polarizable force fields.

Abstract
We introduce an iterative algorithm to efficiently simulate protein folding and other conformational transitions, using state-of-the-art all-atom force fields. Starting from the Langevin equation, we obtain a self-consistent stochastic equation of motion, which directly yields the reaction pathways. From the solution of this set of equations we derive a stochastic estimate of the reaction coordinate. We validate this approach against the results of plain MD simulations of the folding of a small protein, which were performed on the Anton supercomputer. In order to explore the computational efficiency of this algorithm, we apply it to generate a folding pathway of a protein that consists of 130 amino acids and has a folding rate of the order of s-1.","Gaussian Accelerated Molecular Dynamics: Theory, Implementation, and Applications

A novel Gaussian Accelerated Molecular Dynamics (GaMD) method has been developed for simultaneous unconstrained enhanced sampling and free energy calculation of biomolecules. Without the need to set predefined reaction coordinates, GaMD enables unconstrained enhanced sampling of the biomolecules. Furthermore, by constructing a boost potential that follows a Gaussian distribution, accurate reweighting of GaMD simulations is achieved via cumulant expansion to the second order. The free energy profiles obtained from GaMD simulations allow us to identify distinct low energy states of the biomolecules and characterize biomolecular structural dynamics quantitatively. In this chapter, we present the theory of GaMD, its implementation in the widely used molecular dynamics software packages (AMBER and NAMD), and applications to the alanine dipeptide biomolecular model system, protein folding, biomolecular large-scale conformational transitions, and biomolecular recognition.
","Structure and polarization near the Li+ ion in ethylene and propylene carbonates

Research on fundamental interactions in Li-ion batteries is accelerating due to the importance of developing batteries with enhanced energy and power densities while maintaining safety. Improving electrode materials and controlling the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase during the first battery charge have been the main focus areas for research. Ion-solvent interactions in the electrolyte are also of great importance in tuning solvation and transport properties, however. Here we present ab initio density functional theory simulations of a Li+ ion in ethylene and propylene carbonates. The aim is to obtain a detailed analysis of local solvation structure and solvent polarization near the ion and in the bulk. The results indicate the significance of molecular polarization for developing accurate solvation models. The simulations illustrate the substantial differences between ion solvation in water and in organic materials.

Abstract: Crystallization is a process of great practical relevance in which rare but crucial fluctuations lead to the formation of a solid phase starting from the liquid. As in all first order first transitions, there is an interplay between enthalpy and entropy. Based on this idea, in order to drive crystallization in molecular simulations, we introduce two collective variables, one enthalpic and the other entropic. Defined in this way, these collective variables do not prejudge the structure into which the system is going to crystallize. We show the usefulness of this approach by studying the cases of sodium and aluminum that crystallize in the bcc and fcc crystalline structures, respectively. Using these two generic collective variables, we perform variationally enhanced sampling and well tempered metadynamics simulations and find that the systems transform spontaneously and reversibly between the liquid and the solid phases.

Abstract
Polysaccharides (carbohydrates) are key regulators of a large number of cell biological processes. However, precise biochemical or genetic manipulation of these often complex structures is laborious and hampers experimental structure-function studies. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations provide a valuable alternative tool to generate and test hypotheses on saccharide function. Yet, currently used MD force fields often overestimate the aggregation propensity of polysaccharides, affecting the usability of those simulations. Here we tested MARTINI, a popular coarse-grained (CG) force field for biological macromolecules, for its ability to accurately represent molecular forces between saccharides. To this end, we calculated a thermodynamic solution property, the second virial coefficient of the osmotic pressure (B22). Comparison with light scattering experiments revealed a non-physical aggregation of a prototypical polysaccharide in MARTINI, pointing at an imbalance of the non-bonded solute-solute, solute-water, and water-water interactions. This finding also applies to smaller oligosaccharides which were all found to aggregate in simulations even at moderate concentrations, well below their solubility limit. Finally, we explored the influence of the Lennard-Jones (LJ) interaction between saccharide molecules and propose a simple scaling of the LJ interaction strength that makes MARTINI more reliable for the simulation of saccharides.

The detection and characterization of binding pockets and allosteric communication in proteins is crucial for studying biological regulation and performing drug design. Nowadays, ever-longer molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are routinely used to investigate the spatiotemporal evolution of proteins. Yet, there is no computational tool that can automatically detect all the pockets and potential allosteric communication networks along these extended MD simulations. Here, we use a novel and fully automated algorithm that examines pocket formation, dynamics, and allosteric communication embedded in microsecond-long MD simulations of three pharmaceutically relevant proteins, namely, PNP, A2A, and Abl kinase. This dynamic analysis uses pocket crosstalk, defined as the temporal exchange of atoms between adjacent pockets, along the MD trajectories as a fingerprint of hidden allosteric communication networks. Importantly, this study indicates that dynamic pocket crosstalk analysis provides new mechanistic understandings on allosteric communication networks, enriching the available experimental data. Thus, our results suggest the prospective use of this unprecedented dynamic analysis to characterize transient binding pockets for structure-based drug design.

Predicting the concentrated solution behavior for monoclonal antibodies requires developing and using minimal models to describe their shape and interaction potential. Toward this end, the small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) profiles for a monoclonal antibody (COE-03) have been measured under solution conditions chosen to produce weak self-association. The experiments are complemented with molecular simulations of a three-bead antibody model with and without interbead attraction. The scattering profile is extracted directly from the molecular simulation to avoid using the decoupling approximation. We examine the ability of the three-bead model to capture features of the scattering profile and the dependence of compressibilty on protein concentration. The three-bead model is able to reproduce generic features of the experimental structure factor as a function of wave vector S(k) including a well-defined shoulder, which is a consequence of the planar structure of the antibody, and a well-defined minimum in S(k) at k ∼ 0.025 Å–1. We also show the decoupling approximation is incapable of accounting for highly anisotropic shapes. The best-fit parameters obtained from matching spherical models to simulated scattering profiles are protein concentration dependent, which limits their applicability for predicting thermodynamic properties. Nevertheless, the experimental compressibility curves can be accurately reproduced by an appropriate parametrization of the Baxter adhesive model, indicating the model provides a semiempirical equation of state for the antibody. The results provide insights into how equations of state can be improved for antibodies by accounting for their anisotropic shapes.

Abstract: Generalized Langevin Equation (GLE) thermostats have been used very effectively as a tool to manip- ulate and optimize the sampling of thermodynamic ensembles and the associated static properties. Here we show that a similar, exquisite level of control can be achieved for the dynamical proper- ties computed from thermostatted trajectories. We develop quantitative measures of the disturbance induced by the GLE to the Hamiltonian dynamics of a harmonic oscillator, and show that these ana- lytical results accurately predict the behavior of strongly anharmonic systems. We also show that it is possible to correct, to a significant extent, the effects of the GLE term onto the corresponding microcanonical dynamics, which puts on more solid grounds the use of non-equilibrium Langevin dynamics to approximate quantum nuclear effects and could help improve the prediction of dynam- ical quantities from techniques that use a Langevin term to stabilize dynamics. Finally we address the use of thermostats in the context of approximate path-integral-based models of quantum nuclear dynamics. We demonstrate that a custom-tailored GLE can alleviate some of the artifacts associated with these techniques, improving the quality of results for the modeling of vibrational dynamics of molecules, liquids, and solids.

Abstract
Understanding of intracellular polymerization of sickle hemoglobin (HbS) and subsequent interaction with the membrane of a red blood cell (RBC) is important to predict the altered morphologies and mechanical properties of sickle RBCs in sickle cell anemia. However, modeling the integrated processes of HbS nucleation, polymerization, HbS fiber interaction, and subsequent distortion of RBCs is challenging as they occur at multispatial scales, ranging from nanometers to micrometers. To make progress toward simulating the integrated processes, we propose a hybrid HbS fiber model, which couples fine-grained and coarse-grained HbS fiber models through a mesoscopic adaptive resolution scheme (MARS). To this end, we apply a microscopic model to capture the dynamic process of polymerization of HbS fibers, while maintaining the mechanical properties of polymerized HbS fibers by the mesoscopic model, thus providing a means of bridging the subcellular and cellular phenomena in sickle cell disease. At the subcellular level, this model can simulate HbS polymerization with preexisting HbS nuclei. At the cellular level, if combined with RBC models, the generated HbS fibers could be applied to study the morphologies and membrane stiffening of sickle RBCs. One important feature of the MARS is that it can be easily employed in other particle-based multiscale simulations where a dynamic coarse-graining and force-blending method is required. As demonstrations, we first apply the hybrid HbS fiber model to simulate the interactions of two growing fibers and find that their final configurations depend on the orientation and interaction distance between two fibers, in good agreement with experimental observations. We also model the formation of fiber bundles and domains so that we explore the mechanism that causes fiber branching.","Transition path sampling of rare events by shooting from the top

Transition path sampling is a powerful tool in the study of rare events. Shooting trial trajectories from configurations along existing transition paths proved particularly efficient in the sampling of reactive trajectories. However, most shooting attempts tend not to result in transition paths, in particular in cases where the transition dynamics has diffusive character. To overcome the resulting efficiency problem, we developed an algorithm for “shooting from the top.” We first define a shooting range through which all paths have to pass and then shoot off trial trajectories only from within this range. For a well chosen shooting range, nearly every shot is successful, resulting in an accepted transition path. To deal with multiple mechanisms, weighted shooting ranges can be used. To cope with the problem of unsuitably placed shooting ranges, we developed an algorithm that iteratively improves the location of the shooting range. The transition path sampling procedure is illustrated for models of diffusive and Langevin dynamics. The method should be particularly useful in cases where the transition paths are long so that only relatively few shots are possible, yet reasonable order parameters are known.","Thermodynamic and Transport Properties of Crown-Ethers: Force Field Development and Molecular Simulations

Crown-ethers have recently been used to assemble porous liquids (PLs), which are liquids with permanent porosity formed by mixing bulky solvent molecules (e.g., 15-crown-5 ether) with solvent-inaccessible organic cages. PLs and crown-ethers belong to a novel class of materials, which can potentially be used for gas separation and storage, but their performance for this purpose needs to be assessed thoroughly. Here, we use molecular simulations to study the gas separation performance of crown-ethers as the solvent of porous liquids. The TraPPE force field for linear ether molecules has been adjusted by fitting a new set of torsional potentials to accurately describe cyclic crown-ether molecules. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been used to compute densities, shear viscosities, and self-diffusion coefficients of 12-crown-4, 15-crown-5, and 18-crown-6 ethers. In addition, Monte Carlo (MC) simulations have been used to compute the solubility of the gases CO2, CH4, and N2 in 12-crown-4 and 15-crown-5 ether. The computed properties are compared with available experimental data of crown-ethers and their linear counterparts, i.e., polyethylene glycol dimethyl ethers.",

Abstract; Additive force fields are designed to account for induced electronic polarization in a mean-field average way using effective empirical fixed charges. The limitation of this approximation is cause for serious concerns, particularly in the case of lipid membranes, where the molecular environment undergoes dramatic variations over microscopic length scales. A polarizable force field based on the classical Drude oscillator offers a practical and computationally efficient framework for an improved representation of electrostatic interactions in molecular simulations. Building on the first-generation Drude polarizable force field for the dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) molecule, the present effort was undertaken to improve this initial model and expand the force field to a wider range of phospholipid molecules. New lipids parameterized include dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC), dilauroylphosphatidylcholine (DLPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DPPE), 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE), and 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE). The iterative optimization protocol employed in this effort led to lipid models that achieve a good balance between reproducing quantum mechanical data on model compound representative of phospholipids and reproducing a range of experimental condensed phase properties of bilayers. A parameterization strategy based on a restrained ensemble - maximum entropy methodology was used to help accurately match the experimental NMR order parameters in the polar headgroup region. All the parameters were developed to be compatible with the remainder of the Drude polarizable force field that includes water, ions, proteins, DNA and selected carbohydrates.

Abstract
Complete free energy surface in the collective variable space provides important information of the reaction mechanisms of the molecules. But, sufficient sampling in the collective variable space is not easy. The space expands quickly with the number of the collective variables. To solve the problem, many methods utilize artificial biasing potentials to flatten out the original free energy surface of the molecule in the simulation. Their performances are sensitive to the definitions of the biasing potentials. Fast-growing biasing potential accelerates the sampling speed but decreases the accuracy of the free energy result. Slow-growing biasing potential gives an optimized result but needs more simulation time. In this article, we propose an alternative method. It adds the biasing potential to a representative point of the molecule in the collective variable space to improve the conformational sampling. And the free energy surface is calculated from the free energy gradient in the constrained simulation, not given by the negative of the biasing potential as previous methods. So the presented method does not require the biasing potential to remove all the barriers and basins on the free energy surface exactly. Practical applications show that the method in this work is able to produce the accurate free energy surfaces for different molecules in a short time period. The free energy errors are small in the cases of various biasing potentials.
 ","Title: Data-driven coarse graining of large biomolecular structures
Authors: Yi-Ling Chen and Michael Habeck
Abstract: Advances in experimental and computational techniques allow us to study the structure and dynamics of large biomolecular assemblies at increasingly higher resolution. However, with increasing structural detail it can be challenging to unravel the mechanism underlying the function of molecular machines. One reason is that atomistic simulations become computationally prohibitive. Moreover it is difficult to rationalize the functional mechanism of systems composed of tens of thousands to millions of atoms by following each atom’s movements. Coarse graining (CG) allows us to understand biological structures from a hierarchical perspective and to gradually zoom into the adequate level of structural detail. This article introduces a Bayesian approach for coarse graining biomolecular structures. We develop a probabilistic model that aims to represent the shape of an experimental structure as a cloud of bead particles. The particles interact via a pairwise potential whose parameters are estimated along with the bead positions and the CG mapping between atoms and beads. Our model can also be applied to density maps obtained by cryo-electron microscopy. We illustrate our approach on various test systems.

Myosin clusters of finite size develop contractile stress in 1D random actin arrays

 

Rubinstein BY, Mogilner A.

Abstract. Myosin-powered force generation and contraction in nonmuscle cells underlies many cell biological processes and is based on contractility of random actin arrays. This contractility must rely on a microscopic asymmetry, the precise mechanism of which is not completely clear. A number of models of mechanical and structural asymmetries in actomyosin contraction have been posited. Here, we examine a contraction mechanism based on a finite size of myosin clusters and anisotropy of force generation by myosin heads at the ends of the myosin clusters. We use agent-based numerical simulations to demonstrate that if average lengths of actin filaments and myosin clusters are similar, then the proposed microscopic asymmetry leads to effective contraction of random 1D actomyosin arrays. We discuss the model's implication for mechanics of contractile rings and stress fibers.

Abstract: Extended Lagrangian Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics [A. M. N. Niklasson, Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 123004 (2008)] is formulated for general Hohenberg-Kohn density-functional theory and com- pared with the extended Lagrangian framework of first principles molecular dynamics by Car and Parrinello [Phys. Rev. Lett. 55, 2471 (1985)]. It is shown how extended Lagrangian Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics overcomes several shortcomings of regular, direct Born-Oppenheimer molecu- lar dynamics, while improving or maintaining important features of Car-Parrinello simulations. The accuracy of the electronic degrees of freedom in extended Lagrangian Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics, with respect to the exact Born-Oppenheimer solution, is of second-order in the size of the integration time step and of fourth order in the potential energy surface. Improved stability over recent formulations of extended Lagrangian Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics is achieved by generalizing the theory to finite temperature ensembles, using fractional occupation numbers in the calculation of the inner-product kernel of the extended harmonic oscillator that appears as a precondi- tioner in the electronic equations of motion. Material systems that normally exhibit slow self-consistent field convergence can be simulated using integration time steps of the same order as in direct Born- Oppenheimer molecular dynamics, but without the requirement of an iterative, non-linear electronic ground-state optimization prior to the force evaluations and without a systematic drift in the total energy. In combination with proposed low-rank and on the fly updates of the kernel, this formula- tion provides an efficient and general framework for quantum-based Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulations.","Title: Impact of a nonuniform charge distribution on virus assembly

Abstract
Many spherical viruses encapsulate their genomes in protein shells with icosahedral symmetry. This process is spontaneous and driven by electrostatic interactions between positive domains on the virus coat proteins and the negative genomes. We model the effect of the nonuniform icosahedral charge distribution from the protein shell instead using a mean-field theory. We find that this nonuniform charge distribution strongly affects the optimal genome length and that it can explain the experimentally observed phenomenon of overcharging of virus and viruslike particles.","Title: Interplay between membrane elasticity and active cytoskeleton forces regulates the aggregation dynamics of the immunological synapse
Authors: Nadiv Dharan and Oded Farago 
Abstract: Adhesion between a T cell and an antigen presenting cell is achieved by TCR-pMHC and LFA1-ICAM1 protein complexes. These segregate to form a special pattern, known as the immunological synapse (IS), consisting of a central quasi-circular domain of TCR-pMHC bonds surrounded by a peripheral domain of LFA1-ICAM1 complexes. Insights gained from imaging studies had led to the conclusion that the formation of the central adhesion domain in the IS is driven by active (ATPdriven) mechanisms. Recent studies, however, suggested that passive (thermodynamic) mechanisms may also play an important role in this process. Here, we present a simple physical model, taking into account the membrane-mediated thermodynamic attraction between the TCR-pMHC bonds and the effective forces that they experience due to ATP-driven actin retrograde flow and transport by dynein motor proteins. Monte Carlo simulations of the model exhibit a good spatio-temporal agreement with the experimentally observed pattern evolution of the TCR-pMHC microclusters. The agreement is lost when one of the aggregation mechanisms is “muted”, which helps to identify the respective roles in the process. We conclude that actin retrograde flow drives the centripetal motion of TCR-pMHC bonds, while the membrane-mediated interactions facilitate microcluster formation and growth. In the absence of dynein motors, the system evolves into a ring-shaped pattern, which highlights the role of dynein motors in the formation of the final concentric pattern. The interplay between the passive and active mechanisms regulates the rate of the accumulation process, which in the absence of one them proceeds either too quickly or slowly.

Buckling-induced F-actin fragmentation modulates the contraction of active cytoskeletal networks 


Jing Li, Thomas Biel, Pranith Lomada, Qilin Yu, Taeyoon Kim. 

Abstract. Actomyosin contractility originating from interactions between F-actin and myosin facilitates various structural reorganizations of the actin cytoskeleton. Cross-linked actomyosin networks show a tendency to contract to single or multiple foci, which has been investigated extensively in numerous studies. Recently, it was suggested that suppression of F-actin buckling via an increase in bending rigidity significantly reduces network contraction. In this study, we demonstrate that networks may show the largest contraction at intermediate bending rigidity, not at the lowest rigidity, if filaments are severed by buckling arising from myosin activity as demonstrated in recent experiments; if filaments are very flexible, frequent severing events can severely deteriorate network connectivity, leading to the formation of multiple small foci and low network contraction. By contrast, if filaments are too stiff, the networks exhibit minimal contraction due to the inhibition of filament buckling. This study reveals that buckling-induced filament severing can modulate the contraction of active cytoskeletal networks, which has been neglected to date.

The best-fit parameters obtained from matching spherical models to simulated scattering profiles are protein concentration dependent, which limits their applicability for predicting thermodynamic properties. Nevertheless, the experimental compressibility curves can be accurately reproduced by an appropriate parameterization of the Baxter adhesive model, indicating the model provides a semi-empirical equation of state for the antibody. The results provide insights into how equations of state can be improved for antibodies by accounting for their anisotropic shapes.

Force percolation of contractile active gels.


Alvarado J., Sheinman M., Sharma A., MacKintosh FC, Koenderink GH.

Abstract. Living systems provide a paradigmatic example of active soft matter. Cells and tissues comprise viscoelastic materials that exert forces and can actively change shape. This strikingly autonomous behavior is powered by the cytoskeleton, an active gel of semiflexible filaments, crosslinks, and molecular motors inside cells. Although individual motors are only a few nm in size and exert minute forces of a few pN, cells spatially integrate the activity of an ensemble of motors to produce larger contractile forces (∼nN and greater) on cellular, tissue, and organismal length scales. Here we review experimental and theoretical studies on contractile active gels composed of actinfilaments and myosin motors. Unlike other active soft matter systems, which tend to form ordered patterns, actin-myosin systems exhibit a generic tendency to contract. Experimental studies of reconstituted actin-myosin model systems have long suggested that a mechanical interplay between motor activity and the network's connectivity governs this contractile behavior. Recent theoretical modelsindicate that this interplay can be understood in terms of percolation models, extended to include effects of motor activity on the network connectivity. Based on concepts from percolation theory, we propose a state diagram that unites a large body of experimental observations. This framework provides valuable insights into the mechanisms that drive cellular shape changes and also provides design principles for synthetic active materials.

Reactive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are a versatile tool which allow for studying reaction pathways and rates simultaneously. However, most reactions will be observed only a few times in such a simulation due to computational limitations or slow kinetics, and it is unclear how this will influence the obtained rate constants. Therefore, we propose a method based on the Poisson distribution to assess the statistical uncertainty of reaction rate constants obtained from reactive MD simulations.
","Title: Structural Properties of Human IAPP Dimer in Membrane Environment Studied by All-Atom Molecular Dynamics Simulations.
Authors: Na Liu, Mojie Duan and Minghui Yang
Abstract: The aggregation of human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) can damage the membrane of the β-cells in the pancreatic islets and induce type 2 diabetes (T2D). Growing evidences indicated that the major toxic species are small oligomers of IAPP. Due to the fast aggregation nature, it is hard to characterize the structures of IAPP oligomers by experiments, especially in the complex membrane environment. On the other side, molecular dynamics simulation can provide atomic details of the structure and dynamics of the aggregation of IAPP. In this study, all-atom bias-exchange metadynamics (BE-Meta) and unbiased molecular dynamics simulations were employed to study the structural properties of IAPP dimer in the membranes environments. A number of intermediates, including α-helical states, β-sheet states, and fully disordered states, are identified. The formation of N-terminal β-sheet structure is prior to the C-terminal β-sheet structure towards the final fibril-like structures. The α-helical intermediates have lower propensity in the dimeric hIAPP and are off-pathway intermediates. The simulations also demonstrate that the β-sheet intermediates induce more perturbation on the membrane than the α-helical and disordered states and thus pose higher disruption ability.

Abstract On mesoscopic scales, lipid membranes are well described by continuum theories whose main ingredients are the curvature of a membrane’s reference surface and the tilt of its lipid constituents. In particular, Hamm and Kozlov [Eur. Phys. J. E 3, 323 (2000)] have shown how to systematically derive such a tilt-curvature Hamiltonian based on the elementary assumption of a thin fluid elastic sheet experiencing internal lateral pre-stress. Performing a dimensional reduction, they not only derive the basic form of the effective surface Hamiltonian but also express its emergent elastic couplings as trans-membrane moments of lower-level material parameters. In the present paper, we argue, though, that their derivation unfortunately missed a coupling term between curvature and tilt. This term arises because, as one moves along the membrane, the curvature-induced change of transverse distances contributes to the area strain—an effect that was believed to be small but nevertheless ends up contributing at the same (quadratic) order as all other terms in their Hamiltonian. We illustrate the consequences of this amendment by deriving the monolayer and bilayer Euler-Lagrange equations for the tilt, as well as the power spectra of shape, tilt, and director fluctuations. A particularly curious aspect of our new term is that its associated coupling constant is the second moment of the lipid monolayer’s lateral stress profile—which within this framework is equal to the monolayer Gaussian curvature modulus, κm. On the one hand, this implies that many theoretical predictions now contain a parameter that is poorly known (because the Gauss-Bonnet theorem limits access to the integrated Gaussian curvature); on the other hand, the appearance of κm outside of its Gaussian curvature provenance opens opportunities for measuring it by more conventional means, for instance by monitoring a membrane’s undulation spectrum at short scales.

The traditional trade-off in biomolecular simulation between accuracy and computational efficiency is predicated on the assumption that detailed forcefields are typically well-parameterized (i.e. obtaining a significant fraction of possible accuracy). We re-examine this trade-off in the more realistic regime in which parameterization is a greater source of bias than the level of detail in the forcefield. To address parameterization of coarse-grained forcefields, we use the contrastive divergence technique from machine learning to train directly from simulation trajectories on 450 proteins. In our scheme, the computational efficiency of the model enables high accuracy through precise tuning of the Boltzmann ensemble over a large collection of proteins. This method is applied to our recently developed Upside model, where the free energy for side chains are rapidly calculated at every time-step, allowing for a smooth energy landscape without steric rattling of the side chains. After our contrastive divergence training, the model is able to fold proteins up to approximately 100 residues de novo on a single core in CPU core-days. Additionally, the improved Upside model is a strong starting point both for investigation of folding dynamics and as an inexpensive Bayesian prior for protein physics that can be integrated with additional experimental or bioinformatic data.",,"Title: Evaluation of mapping schemes for systematic coarse graining of higher alkanes

Abstract A model is introduced to explore the influence of different coarse-grained (CG) resolutions on the structural and thermodynamic properties of higher alkanes. Four different mapping schemes are considered, for which the potentials are derived using the conditional reversible work (CRW) method. The CRW method is a bottom-up coarse-graining procedure, which derives effective pair potentials between nonbonded chemical groups defined by the mapping scheme from the underlying molecular interactions in a quick, inexpensive way. We consider the applicability of CRW for mapping sites including up to four heavy atoms and study the properties of n-dodecane and n-tetracosane in the liquid state. Both chemical and thermodynamic transferability are achieved for high resolution representations. However, the ability of the coarse-grained model to effectively describe the system deteriorates as the size of the mapping is increased and sampling issues arise. By looking at the configuration distributions of the dihedrals in the atomistic sampling runs (gas phase), it is shown that the gauche population is underrepresented. Here we address the problem and propose a viable solution to recover the agreement between atomistic and low resolution coarse-grained representation. All the CRW potentials presented in the paper are reported in tabulated and analytical form.",

Abstract Advances in experimental and computational techniques allow us to study the structure and dynamics of large biomolecular assemblies at increasingly higher resolution. However, with increasing structural detail it can be challenging to unravel the mechanism underlying the function of molecular machines. One reason is that atomistic simulations become computationally prohibitive. Moreover it is difficult to rationalize the functional mechanism of systems composed of tens of thousands to millions of atoms by following each atom’s movements. Coarse graining (CG) allows us to understand biological structures from a hierarchical perspective and to gradually zoom into the adequate level of structural detail. This article introduces a Bayesian approach for coarse graining biomolecular structures. We develop a probabilistic model that aims to represent the shape of an experimental structure as a cloud of bead particles. The particles interact via a pairwise potential whose parameters are estimated along with the bead positions and the CG mapping between atoms and beads. Our model can also be applied to density maps obtained by cryo-electron microscopy. We illustrate our approach on various test systems.",

Abstract In our previous study, all-atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) calculations have been carried out for the aggregation of ionic sodium dodecyl sulfate in water [S. Kawada et al., Chem. Phys. Lett. 646, 36 (2016)]. Aggregates of 20-30 dodecyl sulfate ions were formed within a short MD run for 10 ns. However, further aggregation did not occur despite a long MD calculation for more than 100 ns. This suggests that strong electrostatic repulsive interactions between the aggregates prevent the fusion of the aggregates. In the present study, mean force and potential of mean force acting between two aggregates with aggregation number N = 30 were evaluated as a function of their separation by MD calculations. The repulsive force becomes strong with decreasing distance between the two aggregates before they merge into one. An origin of the repulsive force is an electric double layer formed by the sulfate group and counter sodium ions. Strength of the repulsive force is in good agreement with the theoretical value given by the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory. Once the aggregates establish contact, the force between them turns to be a large attractive force that can be explained by the interfacial tension. In order to form a single micelle from the two aggregates, it is necessary for them to climb over a free energy barrier of 23 kJ/mol. Once, the barrier is overcome, the micelle is stabilized by ∼200 kJ/mol. The time constant of aggregation evaluated from the calculated free energy barrier was about 28 µs at the concentration in our previous study.

Abstract We study a three-dimensional system of self-propelled Brownian particles interacting via the LennardJones potential. Using Brownian dynamics simulations in an elongated simulation box, we investigate the steady states of vapour-liquid phase coexistence of active Lennard-Jones particles with planar interfaces.We measure the normal and tangential components of the pressure tensor along the direction perpendicular to the interface and verify mechanical equilibrium of the two coexisting phases. In addition, we determine the non-equilibrium interfacial tension by integrating the difference of the normal and tangential components of the pressure tensor and show that the surface tension as a function of strength of particle attractions is well fitted by simple power laws. Finally, we measure the interfacial stiffness using capillary wave theory and the equipartition theorem and find a simple linear relation between surface tension and interfacial stiffness with a proportionality constant characterized by an effective temperature.

Abstract: We apply a recently proposed ring polymer surface hopping (RPSH) approach to investigate the real-time nonadiabatic dynamics with explicit nuclear quantum effects. The nonadibatic electronic transitions are described through Tully’s fewest-switches surface hopping algorithm and the motion of the nuclei are quantized through the ring polymer Hamiltonian in the extended phase space. Applying the RPSH method to simulate Tully’s avoided crossing models, we demonstrate the critical role of the nuclear tunneling effect and zero-point energy for accurately describing the transmission and reflection probabilities with low initial momenta. In addition, in Tully’s extended coupling model, we show that the ring polymer quantization effectively captures decoherence, yielding more accurate reflection probabilities. These promising results demonstrate the potential of using RPSH as an accurate and efficient method to incorporate nuclear quantum effects into nonadiabatic dynamics simulations.

Abstract Cellular membranes are fundamental constituents of living organisms. Apart from defining the boundaries of the cells, they are involved in a wide range of biological functions, associated to both their structural and the dynamical properties. Bio-membranes can undergo large-scale transformations when subject to specific environmental changes, including gel-liquid phase transitions, change of aggregation structure, formation of microtubules, or rupture into vesicles. All these processes are dependent on a delicate interplay between intermolecular forces, molecular crowding, and entropy, and their understanding requires approaches that are able to capture and rationalize the details of all the involved interactions. Molecular dynamics-based computational models at the atom-level resolution are in principle the best way to perform such investigations. Unfortunately, the relevant spatial and time dimensionalities involved in membrane remodeling phenomena would require computational costs that are today unaffordable on a routinely basis. Such hurdles can be removed by coarse-graining the representations of the individual molecular components of the systems. This procedure anyway reduces the possibility of describing the chemical variations in the lipid mixtures composing biological membranes. New hybrid particle-field multi-scale approaches offer today a promising alternative to the more traditional particle-based simulations methods. By combining chemically distinguishable molecular representations with mesoscale-based computationally affordable potentials, they appear as one of the most promising ways to keep an accurate description of the chemical complexity of biological membranes and, at the same time, to cover the required scales to describe remodeling events.","Density functional theory formulation for fluid adsorption on correlated random surfaces

The Journal of Chemical Physics 147, 154703 (2017)

We provide novel random surface density functional theory (RSDFT) formulation in the case of geometric heterogeneous surfaces of solid media which is essential for the description of thermodynamic properties of confined fluids. The major difference of our theoretical approach from the existing ones is a stochastic model of solid surfaces which takes into account the correlation properties of geometry. The main building blocks are effective fluid-solid potentials developed in the work of Khlyupin and Aslyamov [J. Stat. Phys. 167, 1519 (2017)] and geometry-based modification of the Helmholtz free energy for Lennard-Jones fluids. The efficiency of RSDFT is demonstrated in the calculation of argon and nitrogen low temperature adsorption on real heterogeneous surfaces (BP280 carbon black). These results are in good agreement with experimental data published in the literature. Also several models of corrugated materials are developed in the framework of RSDFT. Numerical analysis demonstrates a strong influence of surface roughness characteristics on adsorption isotherms. Thus the developed formalism provides a connection between a rigorous description of the stochastic surface and confined fluid thermodynamics.",,

Abstract: Proteins that are functional at ambient conditions do not necessarily work at extreme conditions of temperature T and pressure P. Furthermore, there are limits of T and P above which no protein has a stable functional state. Here, we show that these limits and the selection mechanisms for working proteins depend on how the properties of the surrounding water change with T and P. We find that proteins selected at high T are superstable and are characterized by a nonextreme segregation of a hydrophilic surface and a hydrophobic core. Surprisingly, a larger segregation reduces the stability range in T and P. Our computer simulations, based on a new protein design protocol, explain the hydropathy profile of proteins as a consequence of a selection process influenced by water. Our results, potentially useful for engineering proteins and drugs working far from ambient conditions, offer an alternative rationale to the evolutionary action exerted by the environment in extreme conditions.","Advancing Drug Discovery through Enhanced Free Energy Calculations

Abstract A principal goal of drug discovery project is to design molecules that can tightly and selectively bind to the target protein receptor. Accurate prediction of protein–ligand binding free energies is therefore of central importance in computational chemistry and computer aided drug design. Multiple recent improvements in computing power, classical force field accuracy, enhanced sampling methods, and simulation setup have enabled accurate and reliable calculations of protein–ligands binding free energies, and position free energy calculations to play a guiding role in small molecule drug discovery. In this Account, we outline the relevant methodological advances, including the REST2 (Replica Exchange with Solute Temperting) enhanced sampling, the incorporation of REST2 sampling with convential FEP (Free Energy Perturbation) through FEP/REST, the OPLS3 force field, and the advanced simulation setup that constitute our FEP+ approach, followed by the presentation of extensive comparisons with experiment, demonstrating sufficient accuracy in potency prediction (better than 1 kcal/mol) to substantially impact lead optimization campaigns. The limitations of the current FEP+ implementation and best practices in drug discovery applications are also discussed followed by the future methodology development plans to address those limitations. We then report results from a recent drug discovery project, in which several thousand FEP+ calculations were successfully deployed to simultaneously optimize potency, selectivity, and solubility, illustrating the power of the approach to solve challenging drug design problems. The capabilities of free energy calculations to accurately predict potency and selectivity have led to the advance of ongoing drug discovery projects, in challenging situations where alternative approaches would have great difficulties. The ability to effectively carry out projects evaluating tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands, of proposed drug candidates, is potentially transformative in enabling hard to drug targets to be attacked, and in facilitating the development of superior compounds, in various dimensions, for a wide range of targets. More effective integration of FEP+ calculations into the drug discovery process will ensure that the results are deployed in an optimal fashion for yielding the best possible compounds entering the clinic; this is where the greatest payoff is in the exploitation of computer driven design capabilities. A key conclusion from the work described is the surprisingly robust and accurate results that are attainable within the conventional classical simulation, fixed charge paradigm. No doubt there are individual cases that would benefit from a more sophisticated energy model or dynamical treatment, and properties other than protein–ligand binding energies may be more sensitive to these approximations. We conclude that an inflection point in the ability of MD simulations to impact drug discovery has now been attained, due to the confluence of hardware and software development along with the formulation of “good enough” theoretical methods and models.",,,

Abstract: In this paper we report that notions of topological protection can be applied to stationary con- figurations that are driven far from equilibrium by active, dissipative processes. We show this for physically two disparate cases : stochastic networks governed by microscopic single particle dynam- ics as well as collections of driven, interacting particles described by coarse-grained hydrodynamic theory. In both cases, the presence of dissipative couplings to the environment that break time reversal symmetry are crucial to ensuring topologically protection. These examples constitute proof of principle that notions of topological protection, established in the context of electronic and me- chanical systems, do indeed extend generically to processes that operate out of equilibrium. Such topologically robust boundary modes have implications for both biological and synthetic systems.

Abstract T-2410 and T-2429 are HIV fusion inhibitor peptides (FI) designed to present a higher efficiency even against HIV strains that developed resistance against other FIs. Similar peptides were shown to interact with model membranes both in the liquid disordered phase and in the liquid ordered state. Those results indicated that such interaction is important to function and could be correlated with their effectiveness. Extensive molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to investigate the interactions between both T-2410 and T-2429 with bilayers of pure 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) and a mixture of POPC/cholesterol (Chol) (1:1). It was observed that both peptides interact strongly with both membrane systems, especially with the POPC/Chol systems, where these peptides show the highest number of H-bonds observed so far. T-2410 and T-2429 showed higher extent of interaction with bilayers when compared to T-20 or T-1249 in previous studies. This is most notable in POPC/Chol membranes where, although able to form H-bonds with Chol, they do so to a lesser extent than T-1249 does, the latter being the only FI peptide so far that was observed to form H-bonds with Chol. This behavior suggests that interaction of FI peptides with rigid Chol rich membranes may not be as dependent from peptide/Chol H-bond formation as previous results of T-1249 behavior led to believe. As in other similar peptides, the higher ability to interact with membranes shown by T-2410 and T2429 is probably correlated with its higher inhibitory efficiency.

DOI: 10.1038/ncomms15873

Abstract Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) involves membrane-associated scaffolds of the bin-amphiphysin-rvs (BAR) domain protein family as well as the GTPase dynamin, and is accompanied and perhaps triggered by changes in local lipid composition. How protein recruitment, scaffold assembly and membrane deformation is spatiotemporally controlled and coupled to fission is poorly understood. We show by computational modelling and super-resolution imaging that phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate [PI(3,4)P2] synthesis within the clathrin-coated area of endocytic intermediates triggers selective recruitment of the PX-BAR domain protein SNX9, as a result of complex interactions of endocytic proteins competing for phospholipids. The specific architecture induces positioning of SNX9 at the invagination neck where its self-assembly regulates membrane constriction, thereby providing a template for dynamin fission. These data explain how lipid conversion at endocytic pits couples local membrane constriction to fission. Our work demonstrates how computational modelling and super-resolution imaging can be combined to unravel function and mechanisms of complex cellular processes.

ABSTRACT: The entire enzyme catalytic mechanism including the electron and the proton transfers of the copper- and zinc-containing extracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD3) was investigated by using QM/MM method. In the first step, the electron transfer from O2•− to SOD3 occurred without the bond formation between the donor and the acceptor and formed the triplet oxygen molecule and reduced SOD3. In the reduced SOD3, the distorted tetrahedral structure of Cu(I) atom was maintained. The reduction of Cu(II) atom induced the protonation of His113, which bridges between the Cu(II) and Zn(II) atoms in the resting state. Since the protonation of His113 broke the bond between Cu(I) and His113, three-coordinated Cu(I) was formed. Further, we suggest the binding of O2•− formed hydrogen peroxide and the resting state after both the Cu reduction and the protonation of His113. The protonation of His113 caused the conformational change of Arg186 located at the entrance of the reactive site. The electrostatic potential surface around the reactive site showed that Arg186 plays an important role as electrostatic guidance for the negatively charged substrates only after the protonation of His113. The rotation of Arg186 switched the proton supply routes via Glu108 or Glu179 for transferring two protons from the bulk solvent.

Abstract Pore forming toxins (PFTs) are virulent proteins whose primary goal is to lyse target cells by unregulated pore formation. Molecular dynamics simulations can potentially provide molecular insights on the properties of the pore complex as well as the underlying pathways for pore formation. In this manuscript we compare both coarse-grained (MARTINI force-field) and all-atom simulations, and comment on the accuracy of the MARTINI coarse-grained method for simulating these large membrane protein pore complexes. We report 20 μs long coarse-grained MARTINI simulations of prototypical pores from two different classes of pore forming toxins (PFTs) in lipid membranes - Cytolysin A (ClyA), which is an example of an α toxin, and α-hemolysin (AHL) which is an example of a β toxin. We compare and contrast structural attributes such as the root mean square deviation (RMSD) histograms and the inner pore radius profiles from the MARTINI simulations with all-atom simulations. RMSD histograms sampled by the MARTINI simulations are about a factor of 2 larger, and the radius profiles show that the transmembrane domains of both ClyA and AHL pores undergo significant distortions, when compared with the all-atom simulations. In addition to the fully inserted transmembrane pores, membrane-inserted proteo-lipid ClyA arcs show large shape distortions with a tendency to close in the MARTINI simulations. While this phenomenon could be biologically plausible given the fact that α-toxins can form pores of varying sizes, the additional flexibility is probably due to weaker inter-protomer interactions which are modulated by the elastic dynamic network in the MARTINI force-field. We conclude that there is further scope for refining inter-protomer contacts and perhaps membrane-protein interactions in the MARTINI coarse-grained framework. A robust coarse-grained force-field will enable one to reliably carry out mesoscopic simulations which are required to understand protomer oligomerization, pore formation and leakage.",,,

Majority of simulations were executed with the SPC/E water model, however, test simulations with TIP3P and OPC water models are also reported. The identity and parametrization of ions strongly affect behavior of a tetramolecular d[GGG]4 GQ, which is unstable with several ion parametrizations. The remaining studied RNA and DNA GQs are structurally stable, though the G-tetrad geometries are always deformed by bifurcated H-bonding in a parametrization-specific manner. Thus, basic 10-µs-scale simulations of fully folded GQs can be safely done with a number of cation parametrizations. However, there are parametrization-specific differences and basic force-field errors affecting quantitative description of ion-tetrad interactions, which may significantly affect studies of the ion-binding processes and description of the GQ folding landscape. Our d[GGG]4 simulations indirectly suggest that such studies will also be sensitive to the water models. During exchanges with bulk water, the Na+ ions move inside the GQs in a concerted manner, while larger relocations of the K+ ions are typically separated. We suggest that the Joung-Cheatham SPC/E K+ parameters represent a safe choice in simulation studies of GQs, though variation of ion parameters can be used for specific simulation goals.

abstract: The effects of crowding in biological environments on biomolecular structure, dynamics, and function remain not well understood. Computer simulations of atomistic models of concentrated peptide and protein systems at different levels of complexity are beginning to provide new insights. Crowding, weak interactions with other macromolecules and metabolites, and altered solvent properties within cellular environments appear to remodel the energy landscape of peptides and proteins in significant ways including the possibility of native state destabilization. Crowding is also seen to affect dynamic properties, both conformational dynamics and diffusional properties of macromolecules. Recent simulations that address these questions are reviewed here and discussed in the context of relevant experiments.

In this article, we suggest simple alternatives to the methods recently used by Jain and Sebastian [ J. Phys. Chem. B 2016, 120, 3988] and Chechkin et al. [ Phys. Rev. X 2017, 7, 021002] to treat a model of non-Gaussian Brownian diffusion based on the dynamics of a particle governed by Ornstein–Uhlenbeck modulated white noise. In addition to substantiating these authors’ earlier findings (which show that a particle can execute a simple random walk even when the distribution of its displacements deviates from Gaussianity), our approach identifies another process, two-state white noise, that exhibits the same “anomalous” Brownian behavior. Indeed, we find that the modulation of white noise by any stochastic process whose time correlation function decays exponentially is likely to behave similarly, suggesting that the occurrence of such behavior can be widespread and commonplace.",,

We present an efficient approach for generating highly accurate molecular potential energy surfaces (PESs) using self-correcting, kernel ridge regression (KRR) based machine learning (ML). We introduce structure-based sampling to automatically assign nuclear configurations from a pre-defined grid to the training and prediction sets, respectively. Accurate high-level ab initio energies are required only for the points in the training set, while the energies for the remaining points are provided by the ML model with negligible computational cost. The proposed sampling procedure is shown to be superior to random sampling and also eliminates the need for training several ML models. Self-correcting machine learning has been implemented such that each additional layer corrects errors from the previous layer. The performance of our approach is demonstrated in a case study on a published high-level ab initio PES of methyl chloride with 44 819 points. The ML model is trained on sets of different sizes and then used to predict the energies for tens of thousands of nuclear configurations within seconds. The resulting datasets are utilized in variational calculations of the vibrational energy levels of CH3Cl. By using both structure-based sampling and self-correction, the size of the training set can be kept small (e.g., 10% of the points) without any significant loss of accuracy. In ab initiorovibrational spectroscopy, it is thus possible to reduce the number of computationally costly electronic structure calculations through structure-based sampling and self-correcting KRR-based machine learning by up to 90%.

abstract: A chemical mixture that continually absorbs work from its environment may exhibit steady-state chemical concentrations that deviate from their equilibrium values. Such behavior is particularly interesting in a scenario where the environmental work sources are relatively difficult to access, so that only the proper orchestration of many distinct catalytic actors can power the dissipative flux required to maintain a stable, far-from-equilibrium steady state. In this article, we study the dynamics of an in silico chemical network with random connectivity in an environment that makes strong thermodynamic forcing available only to rare combinations of chemical concentrations. We find that the long-time dynamics of such systems are biased toward states that exhibit a fine-tuned extremization of environmental forcing.",,,

The mechanism of the catalytic hydrolysis of N-succinyl diaminopimelic acid by the microbial enzyme DapE in its wild-type form as well as three of its mutants (E134D, H67A, and H349A) is investigated employing hybrid quantum-mechanics molecular-mechanics (QM/MM) method coupled with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, wherein the time evolution of the atoms of QM and MM regions are obtained from the forces acting on the individual atoms. The free-energy profiles along the reaction coordinates of this multi-step hydrolysis reaction process is explored using a combination of equilibrium and nonequilibrium (umbrella sampling) QM/MM-MD simulation techniques. In the wt-DapE and the E134D mutant, the nucleophilic attack is found to be the rate determining step involving a barrier of 15.3 kcal/mol and 21.5 kcal/mol, respectively, which explain satisfactorily the free energy of activation obtained from kinetic experiments in the wt-DapE (15.2 kcal/mol) and the three orders of magnitude decrease in the catalytic activity due to E134D mutation. The catalysis is found to be quenched in the H67A and H349A mutants of DapE due to the conformational rearrangement in the active site induced by the absence of the active site His residues that prohibits the activation of the catalytic water molecule.

abstract: The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a conserved homeostatic program that is activated by misfolded proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Recently, it became evident that aberrant lipid compositions of the ER membrane, referred to as lipid bilayer stress, are equally potent in activating the UPR. The underlying molecular mechanism, however, remained unclear. We show that the most conserved transducer of ER stress, Ire1, uses an amphipathic helix (AH) to sense membrane aberrancies and control UPR activity. In vivo and in vitro experiments, together with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, identify the physicochemical properties of the membrane environment that control Ire1 oligomerization. This work establishes the molecular mechanism of UPR activation by lipid bilayer stress.",,,

DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpca.7b04866
Despite the quantum nature of molecules, Classical Mechanics is often employed to describe molecular motions that play a fundamental role in a wide range of phenomena including chemical reactions. This is due to the need of assigning well defined positions to the atomic nuclei during the time evolution of the system in order to describe unambiguously the molecular motions, whereas Quantum Mechanics provides information of probabilistic nature only. One would like to employ a quantum molecular trajectory that defines rigorously the instantaneous nuclear positions and, simultaneously, guarantees the conservation of all Quantum Mechanics predictions unlike the classical trajectory. We argue that such a quantum molecular trajectory can be formally defined and we prove that it corresponds to a single Bohm trajectory. Our analysis establishes a clear correspondence between the statistical properties of the trajectory and the quantum expectation values. The obvious and undeniable benefit is that of dealing with a quantum methodology fully characterizing the molecular motions without any reference to Classical Mechanics.","

A cytoskeletal clutch mediates cellular force transmission in a soft, three-dimensional extracellular matrix.

Owen LM, Adhikari AS, Patel M, Grimmer P, Leijnse N, Kim MC, Notbohm J, Franck C, Dunn AR

Abstract. The ability of cells to impart forces and deformations on their surroundings underlies cell migration and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and is thus an essential aspect of complex, metazoan life. Previous work has resulted in a refined understanding, commonly termed the molecular clutch model, of how cells adhering to flat surfaces such as a microscope coverslip transmit cytoskeletally generated forces to their surroundings. Comparatively less is known about how cells adhere to and exert forces in soft, three-dimensional (3D), and structurally heterogeneous ECM environments such as occur in vivo. We used time-lapse 3D imaging and quantitative image analysis to determine how the actin cytoskeleton is mechanically coupled to the surrounding matrix for primary dermal fibroblasts embedded in a 3D fibrin matrix. Under these circumstances, the cytoskeletal architecture is dominated by contractile actin bundles attached at their ends to large, stable, integrin-based adhesions. Time-lapse imaging reveals that α-actinin-1 puncta within actomyosin bundles move more quickly than the paxillin-rich adhesion plaques, which in turn move more quickly than the local matrix, an observation reminiscent of the molecular clutch model. However, closer examination did not reveal a continuous rearward flow of the actin cytoskeleton over slower moving adhesions. Instead, we found that a subset of stress fibers continuously elongated at their attachment points to integrin adhesions, providing stable, yet structurally dynamic coupling to the ECM. Analytical modeling and numerical simulation provide a plausible physical explanation for this result and support a picture in which cells respond to the effective stiffness of local matrix attachment points. The resulting dynamic equilibrium can explain how cells maintain stable, contractile connections to discrete points within ECM during cell migration, and provides a plausible means by which fibroblasts contract provisional matrices during wound healing.

Actin cortex architecture regulates cell surface tension.

Chugh P, Clark AG, Smith MB, Cassani DAD, Dierkes K, Ragab A, Roux PP, Charras G, Salbreux G, Paluch EK.

Abstract.Animal cell shape is largely determined by the cortex, a thin actin network underlying the plasma membrane in which myosin-driven stresses generate contractile tension. Tension gradients result in local contractions and drive cell deformations. Previous cortical tension regulation studies have focused on myosin motors. Here, we show that cortical actin network architecture is equally important. First, we observe that actin cortex thickness and tension are inversely correlated during cell-cycle progression. We then show that the actinfilament length regulators CFL1, CAPZB and DIAPH1 regulate mitotic cortex thickness and find that both increasing and decreasing thickness decreases tension in mitosis. This suggests that the mitotic cortex is poised close to a tension maximum. Finally, using a computational model, we identify a physical mechanism by which maximum tension is achieved at intermediate actin filament lengths. Our results indicate that actin network architecture, alongside myosin activity, is key to cell surface tension regulation.

,"Computational simulation of formin-mediated actin polymerization predicts homologue-dependent mechanosensitivity.

Bryant D, Clemens L, Allard J

Abstract. Many actin structures are nucleated and assembled by the barbed-end tracking polymerase formin family, including filopodia, focal adhesions, the cytokinetic ring and cell cortex. These structures respond to forces in distinct ways. Formins typically have profilin-actin binding sites embedded in highly flexible disordered FH1 domains, hypothesized to diffusively explore space to rapidly capture actin monomers for delivery to the barbed end. Recent experiments demonstrate that formin-mediated polymerization accelerates when under tension. The acceleration has been attributed to modifying the state of the FH2 domain of formin. Intriguingly, the same acceleration is reported when tension is applied to the FH1 domains, ostensibly pulling monomers away from the barbed end. Here we develop a mesoscale coarse-grain model of formin-mediated actin polymerization, including monomer capture and delivery by FH1, which sterically interacts with actin along its entire length. The binding of actin monomers to their specific sites on FH1 is entropically disfavored by the high disorder. We find that this penalty is attenuated when force is applied to the FH1 domain by revealing the binding site, increasing monomer capture efficiency. Overall polymerization rates can decrease or increase with increasing force, depending on the length of FH1 domain and location of binding site. Our results suggest that the widely varying FH1 lengths and binding site locations found in known formins could be used to differentially respond to force, depending on the actin structure being assembled.

Coarse-grained simulation models are developed to study both template-bound and free porphyrin nanoring systems. Key interactions are modelled with relatively simple (and physically-motivated) energy functions which allow for relatively facile transfer both between different ring sizes and between the template-bound and free nanoring systems. The effects of varying the model parameters on the respective radii of gyration are determined. The effects of including different templates on the ring structure are investigated both in terms of the detailed geometry of the template and the interaction strength between the template and the metal centres in the nanorings. The role of the template-nanoring interaction strength in controlling potential ``caterpillar track'' rotational motion is discussed. The relationship of the model to experimental small-angle X-ray, exchange spectroscopy and electron spin resonance results is discussed.

Many structural and mechanical properties of crystals, glasses, and biological macromolecules can be modeled from the local interactions between atoms. These interactions ultimately derive from the quantum nature of electrons, which can be prohibitively expensive to simulate. Machine learning has the potential to revolutionize materials modeling due to its ability to efficiently approximate complex functions. For example, neural networks can be trained to reproduce results of density functional theory calculations at a much lower cost. However, how neural networks reach their predictions is not well understood, which has led to them being used as a “black box” tool. This lack of understanding is not desirable especially for applications of neural networks in scientific inquiry. We argue that machine learning models trained on physical systems can be used as more than just approximations since they had to “learn” physical concepts in order to reproduce the labels they were trained on. We use dimensionality reduction techniques to study in detail the representation of silicon atoms at different stages in a neural network, which provides insight into how a neural network learns to model atomic interactions.

Abstract: Multidrug resistance against the existing antibiotics is one of the most challenging threats across the globe. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), in this regard, are considered to be one of the effective alternatives that can overcome bacterial resistance. MSI-594, a 24-residue linear alpha-helical cationic AMP, has been shown to function via the carpet mechanism to disrupt bacterial membrane systems. To better understand the role of lipid composition in the function of MSI-594, in the present study, eight different model membrane systems have been studied using accelerated molecular dynamics (aMD) simulations. The simulated results are helpful in discriminating the particular effects of cationic MSI-594 against zwitterionic POPC, anionic POPG and POPS, and neutral POPE lipid moieties. Additionally, the effects of various heterogeneous POPC/POPG (7 : 3), POPC/POPS (7 : 3), and POPG/POPE (1 : 3 and 3 : 1) bilayer systems on the dynamic interaction of MSI-594 have also been investigated. The effect on the lipid bilayer due to the interaction with the peptide is characterized by lipid acyl-chain order, membrane thickness, and acyl-chain dynamics. Our simulation results show that the lipid composition affects the membrane interaction of MSI-594, suggesting that membrane selectivity is crucial to its mechanism of action. The results reported in this study are helpful to obtain accurate atomistic-level information governing MSI-594 and its membrane disruptive antimicrobial mechanism of action, and to design next generation potent antimicrobial peptides.

Authors: Herre Jelger Risselada

Abstract: Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations are applied to explore the experimentally observed ability of the liquid-ordered (lo)/liquid-disordered (ld) phase boundary to facilitate viral membrane fusion. Surprisingly, a formed fusion stalk can be both attracted (i.e., stalkophilic) and repelled (i.e., stalkophobic) by the lo/ld phase boundary. The phase boundary becomes stalkophilic if the lo phase constituents have the larger negative spontaneous curvature. In such a case, location of the highly curved stalk near the less-ordered and thus (relatively) softer boundary region becomes energetically favorable. These insights may explain why modeled viral fusion occurs preferentially near the lo/ld phase boundary.

Abstract: To better understand the conformational properties of the glycan shield covering the surface of the HIV gp120/gp41 envelope (Env) trimer, and how the glycan shield impacts the accessibility of the underlying protein surface, we performed enhanced sampling molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a model glycosylated HIV Env protein and related systems. Our simulation studies revealed a conformationally heterogeneous glycan shield with a network of glycan-glycan interactions more extensive than those observed to date. We found that partial preorganization of the glycans potentially favors binding by established broadly neutralizing antibodies; omission of several specific glycans could increase the accessibility of other glycans or regions of the protein surface to antibody or CD4 receptor binding; the number of glycans that can potentially interact with known antibodies is larger than that observed in experimental studies; and specific glycan conformations can maximize or minimize interactions with individual antibodies. More broadly, the enhanced sampling MD simulations described here provide a valuable tool to guide the engineering of specific Env glycoforms for HIV vaccine design.

"BayesWHAM: A Bayesian approach for free energy estimation, reweighting, and uncertainty quantification in the weighted histogram analysis method
Ferguson, Andrew L. Journal of Computational Chemistry  http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jcc.24800
The weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM) is a powerful approach to estimate molecular free energy surfaces (FES) from biased simulation data. Bayesian reformulations of WHAM are valuable in proving statistically optimal use of the data and providing a transparent means to incorporate regularizing priors and estimate statistical uncertainties. In this work, we develop a fully Bayesian treatment of WHAM to generate statistically optimal FES estimates in any number of biasing dimensions under arbitrary choices of the Bayes prior. Rigorous uncertainty estimates are generated by Metropolis-Hastings sampling from the Bayes posterior. We also report a means to project the FES and its uncertainties into arbitrary auxiliary order parameters beyond those in which biased sampling was conducted. We demonstrate the approaches in applications of alanine dipeptide and the unthreading of a synthetic mimic of the astexin-3 lasso peptide. Open-source MATLAB and Python implementations of our codes are available for free public download.

The potential energy landscape perspective provides both a conceptual and a computational framework for predicting, understanding and designing molecular properties. In this Feature Article we highlight some recent advances that greatly facilitate structure prediction and analysis of global thermodynamics and kinetics in proteins and nucleic acids. The geometry optimisation procedures on which these calculations are based can be accelerated significantly using local rigidification of selected degrees of freedom, and through implementations on graphics processing units. Results of progressive local rigidification are first summarised for trpzip1, including a systematic analysis of the heat capacity and rearrangement rates. Benchmarks for all the essential optimisation procedures are then provided for a variety of proteins. Applications are then illustrated from a study of how mutation affects the energy landscape for a coiled-coil protein, and for transitions in helix morphology for a DNA duplex. Both systems exhibit an intrinsically multifunnel landscape, with the potential to act as biomolecular switches.

Abstract In recent years it has become increasingly popular to construct coarse-grained models with non-Markovian dynamics in order to account for an incomplete separation of time scales. One challenge of a systematic coarse-graining procedure is the extraction of the dynamical properties, namely the memory kernel, from equilibrium all-atom simulations. In this paper we propose an iterative method for memory reconstruction from dynamical correlation functions. Compared to previously proposed non-iterative techniques, it ensures by construction that the target correlation functions of the original fine-grained systems are reproduced accurately by the coarse-grained system, regardless of time step and discretization effects. Furthermore, we also propose a new numerical integrator for generalized Langevin equations that is significantly more accurate then the more commonly used generalization of the Velocity-Verlet integrator. We demonstrate the performance of the above described methods using the example of backflow induced memory in the Brownian diffusion of a single colloid. For this system we are able to reconstruct realistic coarse-grained dynamics with time steps about 200 times larger than used in the original molecular dynamics simulations.","Estimating thermodynamic expectations and free energies in expanded ensemble simulations: Systematic variance reduction through conditioning
Manuel Athènesand Pierre Terrier
The Journal of Chemical Physics 146, 194101 (2017); doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4983164
Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are primarily used for sampling from a given probability distribution and estimating multi-dimensional integrals based on the information contained in the generated samples. Whenever it is possible, more accurate estimates are obtained by combining Monte Carlo integration and integration by numerical quadrature along particular coordinates. We show that this variance reduction technique, referred to as conditioning in probability theory, can be advantageously implemented in expanded ensemble simulations. These simulations aim at estimating thermodynamic expectations as a function of an external parameter that is sampled like an additional coordinate. Conditioning therein entails integrating along the external coordinate by numerical quadrature. We prove variance reduction with respect to alternative standard estimators and demonstrate the practical efficiency of the technique by estimating free energies and characterizing a structural phase transition between two solid phases.

The relationship between the normal modes of a protein and its functional conformational change has been studied for decades. However, using this relationship in a predictive context remains a challenge. In this work, we demonstrate that, starting from a given protein conformer, it is possible to generate in a single step model conformers that are less than 1 Å (Cα-RMSD) from the conformer which is the known endpoint of the conformational change, particularly when the conformational change is collective in nature. Such accurate model conformers can be generated by following either the so-called robust or the 50 lowest-frequency modes obtained with various Elastic Network Models (ENMs). Interestingly, the quality of many of these models compares well with actual crystal structures, as assessed by the ROSETTA scoring function and PROCHECK. The most accurate and best quality conformers obtained in the present study were generated by using the 50 lowest-frequency modes of an all-atom ENM. However, with less than ten robust modes, which are identified without any prior knowledge of the nature of the conformational change, nearly 90% of the motion described by the 50 lowest-frequency modes of a protein can be captured. Such results strongly suggest that exploring the robust modes of ENMs may prove efficient for sampling the functionally relevant conformational repertoire of many proteins.
 ","Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations allow the exploration of the phase space of biopolymers through the integration of equations of motion of their constituent atoms. The analysis of MD trajectories often relies on the choice of collective variables (CVs) along which the dynamics of the system is projected. We developed a graphical user interface (GUI) for facilitating the interactive choice of the appropriate CVs. The GUI allows: defining interactively new CVs; partitioning the configurations into microstates characterized by similar values of the CVs; calculating the free energies of the microstates for both unbiased and biased (metadynamics) simulations; clustering the microstates in kinetic basins; visualizing the free energy landscape as a function of a subset of the CVs used for the analysis.

Abstract We report direct folding study of seven helical proteins (2I9M, Trpcage, 1WN8, C34, N36, 2KES, 2KHK) ranging from 17 to 53 amino acids through standard molecular dynamics simulation using a recently developed polarizable force field-Effective Polarizable Bond (EPB) method. The backbone RMSDs, radius of gyrations, native contacts and native helix content are in good agreement with experimental results. Cluster analysis also verified that these folded structures with the highest population are in good agreement with their corresponding native structures for these proteins. In addition, the free energy landscape of seven proteins in the two dimensional space comprised of RMSD and radius of gyration proved that these folded structures are indeed the lowest energy conformations. However, when the corresponding simulations were performed using the standard (nonpolarizable) AMBER force fields, no stable folded structures were observed for these proteins. Comparison of the simulation results based on polarizable EPB force field and nonpolariable AMBER force field clearly demonstrates the importance of polarization in the folding of stable helical structures.","The Journal of Chemical Physics 146, 195101 (2017); doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4983222
The effect of preferential binding of solute molecules within an aqueous solution on the structure and dynamics of the histone H3.1 protein is examined by a coarse-grained Monte Carlo simulation. The knowledge-based residue-residue and hydropathy-index-based residue-solvent interactions are used as input to analyze a number of local and global physical quantities as a function of the residue-solvent interaction strength (f). Results from simulations that treat the aqueous solution as a homogeneous effective solvent medium are compared to when positional fluctuations of the solute molecules are explicitly considered. While the radius of gyration (Rg) of the protein exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on solvent interaction over a wide range of f within an effective medium, an abrupt collapse in Rg occurs in a narrow range of f when solute molecules rapidly bind to a preferential set of sites on the protein. The structure factor S(q) of the protein with wave vector (q) becomes oscillatory in the collapsed state, which reflects segmental correlations caused by spatial fluctuations in solute-protein binding. Spatial fluctuations in solute binding also modify the effective dimension (D) of the protein in fibrous (D ∼ 1.3), random-coil (D ∼ 1.75), and globular (D ∼ 3) conformational ensembles as the interactionstrength increases, which differ from an effective medium with respect to the magnitude of D and the length scale.

The determination of accurate equilibrium molecular structures plays a fundamental role for understanding many physical-chemical properties of molecules, ranging from the precise evaluation of the electronic structure to the analysis of dynamical and environmental effects in tuning their overall behavior. For this purpose the so-called semiexperimental approach, based on a nonlinear least-squares fit of the moments of inertia associated with a set of available isotopologues, allows one to obtain very accurate results, without the unfavorable computational cost characterizing high-level quantum chemical methods. In the present work the MSR (Molecular Structure Refinement) software for the determination of equilibrium structures by means of the semiexperimental approach is presented, and its implementation is discussed in some detail. The software, which is interfaced with a powerful graphical user interface, includes different optimization algorithms, an extended error analysis, and a number of advanced features, the most remarkable ones concerning the choice of internal coordinates and the method of predicate observations. In particular, a new black-box scheme for defining automatically a suitable set of nonredundant internal coordinates of A1 symmetry in place of the customary Z-matrix has been designed and tested. Finally, the implementation of the method of the predicate observations is discussed and validated for a set of test molecules. As an original application, the method is employed for the determination of the semiexperimental structure for the most stable conformer of glycine.","Structural mass spectrometry with its various techniques is a powerful tool for the structural elucidation of medically relevant protein assemblies. It delivers information on the composition, stoichiometries, interactions and topologies of these assemblies. Most importantly it can deal with heterogeneous mixtures and assemblies which makes it universal among the conventional structural techniques. In this review we summarise recent advances and challenges in structural mass spectrometric techniques. We describe how the combination of the different mass spectrometry-based methods with computational strategies enable structural models at molecular levels of resolution. These models hold significant potential for helping us in characterizing the function of protein assemblies related to human health and disease.

Abstract Replica-exchange enveloping distribution sampling (RE-EDS) allows the efficient estimation of free-energy differences between multiple end-states from a single molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. In EDS, a reference state is sampled, which can be tuned by two kinds of parameters, i.e. smoothness parameters(s) and energy offsets, such that all end-states are sufficiently sampled. The choice of these parameters is, however, not trivial. Replica exchange (RE) or parallel tempering is a widely applied technique to enhance sampling. By combining EDS with the RE technique, the parameter choice problem could be simplified and the challenge shifted towards an optimal distribution of the replicas in the smoothness-parameter space. The choice of a certain replica distribution can alter the sampling efficiency significantly. In this work, global round- trip time optimisation (GRTO) algorithms are tested for the use in RE-EDS simulations. In addition, a local round-trip time optimisation (LRTO) algorithm is proposed for systems with slowly adapting environments, where a reliable estimate for the round- trip time is challenging to obtain. The optimisation algorithms were applied to RE-EDS simulations of a system of nine small-molecule inhibitors of phenylethanolamine N -methyltransferase (PNMT). The energy offsets were determined using the recently proposed parallel energy-offset (PEOE) estimation scheme. While multi-state GRTO algorithm yielded the best replica distribution for the ligands in water, the multi-state LRTO algorithm was found to be the method of choice for the ligands in complex with PNMT. With this, the 36 alchemical free-energy differences between the nine ligands were calculated successfully from a single RE-EDS simulation of 10 ns length. RE-EDS presents thus an efficient method for the estimation of relative binding free energies.","Fast exploration of an optimal path on the multidimensional free energy surface

In a reaction, determination of an optimal path with a high reaction rate (or a low free energy barrier) is important for the study of the reaction mechanism. This is a complicated problem that involves lots of degrees of freedom. For simple models, one can build an initial path in the collective variable space by the interpolation method first and then update the whole path constantly in the optimization. However, such interpolation method could be risky in the high dimensional space for large molecules. On the path, steric clashes between neighboring atoms could cause extremely high energy barriers and thus fail the optimization. Moreover, performing simulations for all the snapshots on the path is also time-consuming. In this paper, we build and optimize the path by a growing method on the free energy surface. The method grows a path from the reactant and extends its length in the collective variable space step by step. The growing direction is determined by both the free energy gradient at the end of the path and the direction vector pointing at the product. With fewer snapshots on the path, this strategy can let the path avoid the high energy states in the growing process and save the precious simulation time at each iteration step. Applications show that the presented method is efficient enough to produce optimal paths on either the two-dimensional or the twelve-dimensional free energy surfaces of different small molecules.",
"Galvelis, R.; Sugita, Y. Neural Network and Nearest Neighbor Algorithms for Enhancing Sampling of Molecular Dynamics. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2017. ASAP

The free energy calculations of complex chemical and biological systems with molecular dynamics (MD) are inefficient due to multiple local minima separated by high-energy barriers. The minima can be escaped using an enhanced sampling method such as metadynamics, which apply bias (i.e., importance sampling) along a set of collective variables (CV), but the maximum number of CVs (or dimensions) is severely limited. We propose a high-dimensional bias potential method (NN2B) based on two machine learning algorithms: the nearest neighbor density estimator (NNDE) and the artificial neural network (ANN) for the bias potential approximation. The bias potential is constructed iteratively from short biased MD simulations accounting for correlation among CVs. Our method is capable of achieving ergodic sampling and calculating free energy of polypeptides with up to 8-dimensional bias potential.
","VS Farafanov and AV Leved, ""Developing and Validating a Set of All-Atom Potential Models for Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate"" J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2017 ASAP Article.

We present a set of novel all-atom potential models for sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), developed within the framework of the widely used OPLS-AA and General AMBER force fields. The choice of the parameters for the models is made by rigorously following the methodology of the used force fields to ensure full compatibility with the models for other compounds. For the GAFF model, extensive quantum-chemical computations are performed to obtain reliable Boltzmann-averaged atomic point charges, and the latter are compared with the single-conformation charges. For representation of the hydrocarbon tail, we use recently published improved parameters that correctly reproduce the properties of lipids and long alkanes. The models are validated on the basis of correct reproduction of the main properties of micelles (size, degree of counterion binding) as well as diffusion coefficient of the SDS monomer. As an extended test, a simulation of a micelle with a high aggregation number (382) and unnatural initial shape is performed, and a restructuring to the correct shape is observed. This proves the suitability of the developed models for simulations of concentrated SDS solutions containing large micelles and also emphasizes the importance of hydrocarbon tail parameters for the micelle properties. Finally, the developed DS– models are tested in combination with several common Na+ and water models. Their effect on the properties of SDS micelles is discussed, and suitable combinations are determined.

Abstract Molecular dynamics simulations are used to explore the effects of chaperonin-like cages on knotted proteins with very low sequence similarity, different depths of a knot but with a similar fold, and the same type of topology. The investigated proteins are VirC2, DndE and MJ0366 with two depths of a knot. A comprehensive picture how encapsulation influences folding rates is provided based on the analysis of different cage sizes and temperature conditions. Neither of these two effects with regard to knotted proteins has been studied by means of molecular dynamics simulations with coarse-grained structure-based models before. We show that encapsulation in a chaperonin is sufficient to self-tie and untie small knotted proteins (VirC2, DndE), for which the equilibrium process is not accessible in the bulk solvent. Furthermore, we find that encapsulation reduces backtracking that arises from the destabilisation of nucleation sites, smoothing the free energy landscape. However, this effect can also be coupled with temperature rise. Encapsulation facilitates knotting at the early stage of folding and can enhance an alternative folding route. Comparison to unknotted proteins with the same fold shows directly how encapsulation influences the free energy landscape. In addition, we find that as the size of the cage decreases, folding times increase almost exponentially in a certain range of cage sizes, in accordance with confinement theory and experimental data for unknotted proteins.

ABSTRACT: We investigate finite-size effects on diffusion in confined fluids using molecular dynamics simulations and hydrodynamic calculations. Specifically, we consider a Lennard-Jones fluid in slit pores without slip at the interface and show that the use of periodic boundary conditions in the directions along the surfaces results in dramatic finite-size effects, in addition to that of the physically relevant confining length. As in the simulation of bulk fluids, these effects arise from spurious hydrodynamic interactions between periodic images and from the constraint of total momentum conservation. We derive analytical expressions for the correction to the diffusion coefficient in the limits of both elongated and flat systems, which are in excellent agreement with the molecular simulation results except for the narrowest pores, where the discreteness of the fluid particles starts to play a role. The present work implies that the diffusion coefficients for wide nanopores computed using elongated boxes suffer from finite-size artifacts which had not been previously appreciated. In addition, our analytical expression provides the correction to be applied to the simulation results for finite (possibly small) systems. It applies not only to molecular but also to all mesoscopic hydrodynamic simulations, including Lattice-Boltzmann, Multi-Particle Collision Dynamics or Dissipative Particle Dynamics, which are often used to investigate confined soft matter involving colloidal particles and polymers.",
"Meshkin, H.; Zhu, F. Thermodynamics of Protein Folding Studied by Umbrella Sampling along a Reaction Coordinate of Native Contacts. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2017. ASAP

Spontaneous transitions between the native and non-native protein conformations are normally rare events that hardly take place in typical unbiased molecular dynamics simulations. It was recently demonstrated that such transitions can be well described by a reaction coordinate, Q, that represents the collective fraction of the native contacts between the protein atoms. Here we attempt to use this reaction coordinate to enhance the conformational sampling. We perform umbrella sampling simulations with biasing potentials on Q for two model proteins, Trp-Cage and BBA, using the CHARMM force field. Hamiltonian replica exchange is implemented in these simulations to further facilitate the sampling. The simulations appear to have reached satisfactory convergence, resulting in unbiased free energies as a function of Q. In addition to the native structure, multiple folded conformations are identified in the reconstructed equilibrium ensemble. Some conformations without any native contacts nonetheless have rather compact geometries and are stabilized by hydrogen bonds not present in the native structure. Whereas the enhanced sampling along Q reasonably reproduces the equilibrium conformational space, we also find that the folding of an α-helix in Trp-Cage is a slow degree of freedom orthogonal to Q and therefore cannot be accelerated by biasing the reaction coordinate. Overall, we conclude that whereas Q is an excellent parameter to analyze the simulations, it is not necessarily a perfect reaction coordinate for enhanced sampling, and better incorporation of other slow degrees of freedom may further improve this reaction coordinate.","AR Hinkle, CH Rycroft, MD Shields, and ML Falk, ""Coarse graining atomistic simulations of plastically deforming amorphous solids"" Phys. Rev. E 95, 053001.

The primary mode of failure in disordered solids results from the formation and persistence of highly localized regions of large plastic strains known as shear bands. Continuum-level field theories capable of predicting this mechanical response rely upon an accurate representation of the initial and evolving states of the amorphous structure. We perform molecular dynamics simulations of a metallic glass and propose a methodology for coarse graining discrete, atomistic quantities, such as the potential energies of the elemental constituents. A strain criterion is established and used to distinguish the coarse-grained degrees-of-freedom inside the emerging shear band from those of the surrounding material. A signal-to-noise ratio provides a means of evaluating the strength of the signal of the shear band as a function of the coarse graining. Finally, we investigate the effect of different coarse-graining length scales by comparing a two-dimensional, numerical implementation of the effective temperature description in the shear transformation zone (STZ) theory with direct molecular dynamics simulations. These comparisons indicate the coarse graining length scale has a lower bound, above which there is a high level of agreement between the atomistic and the STZ theory, and below which the concept of effective temperature breaks down.

Abstract We have carried out a large scale computational investigation to assess the utility of common classical force fields for computational screening of low energy conformers. Using statistical analyses on the energies and relative rankings of up to 250 diverse conformers of 700 different molecular structures, we find that energies from widely-used classical force fields (MMFF94, UFF, and GAFF) show unconditionally poor energy and rank correlation with semiempirical (PM7) and Kohn-Sham density functional theory energies calculated at PM7 geometries (B3LYP-D3BJ//PM7). In contrast, semiempirical PM7 show significantly better correlation with Kohn-Sham hybrid density functional calculations. With these results, we make recommendations for how to more reliably carry out conformer screening.","Toda, S.; Shigeto, S.; Hydrogen Bonded Structures of Confined Water Molecules and Electric Field Induced Shift of Their Equilibrium Revealed by IR Electroabsorption Spectroscopy; The Journal of Physical Chemistry B 2017, 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b02171.

ABSTRACT: Water confined on a nanometer scale plays an essential role in various chemical and biological processes. Confined water molecules are often exposed to electric fields as manifested by those that occur on protein surfaces or in electrical double layers, but the electric field effects on confined water are not fully understood. We used IR electroabsorption (EA) spectroscopy with unprecedented sensitivity to observe electric-field-induced changes in the OH stretching absorption of water (H2O) molecules dissolved in 1,4-dioxane, which constitute a simple model system for confined water. A multivariate curve resolution analysis of the normal IR spectra (without an electric field) of water in 1,4-dioxane at different concentrations indicates the presence of the monomer and dimer of the confined water molecules and equilibrium between them. We find that the IR EA spectrum that is free from the contribution of field-induced molecular reorientation is mainly attributable to a field-induced shift of the equilibrium toward the dimer. This result demonstrates a possible control of the polarity of confined water by simply applying an external electric field and the ability of our method to elucidate how it is achieved.

We carry out a linear elastic analysis to study wavy structure generation on lipid membrane by peripheral membrane proteins. We model the lipid membrane as linearly elastic and anisotropic material. The hydrophobic insertion by proteins into the lipid membrane has been idealized as penetration of rigid rodlike inclusions into the membrane and the electrostatic interaction between protein and membrane has been modeled by a distributed surface traction acting on the membrane surface. With the proposed model we study curvature generation by several binding domains of peripheral membrane proteins containing BAR domains and amphipathic alpha-helices. It is observed that electrostatic interaction is essential for curvature generation by the BAR domains.

A new coarse-grained molecular dynamics double-stranded DNA model (nCG-dsDNA model) using an improved beads–spring model was proposed. In this model, nucleotide comprising phosphate, sugar, and base group were replaced by a single bead. The double stranded model with 202 base pairs was created to tune the parameters of the bond, the nonbond, stack, angle bending, and electrostatic interaction. The average twisted angle and the persistence length of the model without electrostatic interaction were calculated at 35.3° and 120.3 bp, confirming that the proposed model successfully realized the experimentally observed double-stranded DNA structure. Moreover, the model with electrostatic interaction was discussed. From calculation results, we confirmed that the dependency of the salt concentration on the persistence length of the nCG-dsDNA model at the 30% charge is in good agreement with the Poisson–Boltzmann theoretical model.","title: Position-Dependent Diffusion Tensors in Anisotropic Media from

Simulation: Oxygen Transport in and through Membranes

authors: A Ghysels, RM Venable, RW Pastor, G Hummer

journal: JCTC DOI:10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00039

abstract:  A Bayesian-based methodology is developed to estimate diffusion tensors from molecular dynamics simulations of permeants in anisotropic media, and is applied to oxygen in lipid bilayers. By a separation of variables in the Smoluchowski diffusion equation, the multidimensional diffusion is reduced to coupled one-dimensional diffusion problems that are treated by discretization. The resulting diffusivity profiles characterize the membrane transport dynamics as a function of the position across the membrane, discriminating between diffusion normal and parallel to the membrane. The methodology is first validated with neat water, neat hexadecane, and a hexadecane slab surrounded by water, the latter being a simple model for a lipid membrane. Next, a bilayer consisting of pure 1-palmitoyl 2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC), and a bilayer mimicking the lipid composition of the inner mitochondrial membrane, including cardiolipin, are investigated. We analyze the detailed time evolution of oxygen molecules, in terms of both normal diffusion through and radial diffusion inside the membrane. Diffusion is fast in the more loosely packed interleaflet region, and anisotropic, with oxygen spreading more rapidly in the membrane plane than normal to it. Visualization of the propagator shows that oxygen enters the membrane rapidly, reaching its thermodynamically favored center in about 1 ns, despite the free energy barrier at the headgroup region. Oxygen transport is quantified by computing the oxygen permeability of the membranes and the average radial diffusivity, which confirm the anisotropy of the diffusion. The position-dependent diffusion constants and free energies are used to construct compartmental models and test assumptions used in estimating permeability, including Overton’s rule. In particular, a hexadecane slab surrounded by water is found to be a poor model of oxygen transport in membranes because the relevant energy barriers differ substantially.","Manna, D.; Kesharwani, M.

ABSTRACT: Benchmark ab initio energies for BEGDB and WATER27 datasets have been re-examined at the MP2 and CCSD(T) levels with both conventional and explicitly correlated (F12) approaches. The basis set convergence of both conventional and explicitly correlated methods has been investigated in detail, both with and without counterpoise corrections. For the MP2 and CCSD–MP2 contributions, rapid basis set convergence observed with explicitly correlated methods compared to conventional methods. However, conventional, orbital-based calculations are preferred for the calculation of the (T) term, since it does not benefit from F12. CCSD(F12*) converges somewhat faster with the basis set than CCSD-F12b for the CCSD-MP2 term. The performance of various DFT methods is also evaluated for the BEGDB dataset, and results show that Head-Gordon’s ωB97X-V and ωB97M-V functionals outperform all other DFT functionals. Counterpoise-corrected DSD-PBEP86 and raw DSD-PBEPBE-NL also perform well and are close to MP2 results. In the WATER27 dataset, the anionic (deprotonated) water clusters exhibit unacceptably slow basis set convergence with the regular cc-pVnZ-F12 basis sets, which only have diffuse s and p functions. To overcome this, we have constructed modified basis sets, denoted aug-cc-pVnZ-F12 or aVnZ-F12, which have been augmented with diffuse functions on the higher angular momenta. The calculated final dissociation energies of BEGDB and WATER27 datasets are available in electronic supporting information. Our best calculated dissociation energies can be reproduced through n-body expansion, provided one pushes to the basis set and electron correlation limit for the 2-body term: for the 3-body term, post-MP2 contributions (particularly CCSD-MP2) are important for capturing the 3-body dispersion effects. Terms beyond 4-body can be adequately captured at the MP2-F12 level.

Abstract Protein side-chain mutation is fundamental both to natural evolutionary processes and to the engineering of protein therapeutics, which constitute an increasing fraction of important medications. Molecular simulation enables the prediction of the effects of mutation on properties such as binding affinity, secondary and tertiary structure, conformational dynamics, and thermal stability. A number of widely differing approaches have been applied to these predictions, including sequence-based algorithms, knowledge-based potential functions, and all-atom molecular mechanics calculations. Free energy perturbation theory, employing all-atom and explicit-solvent molecular dynamics simulations, is a rigorous physics-based approach for calculating thermodynamic effects of, for example, protein side-chain mutations. Over the past several years, we have initiated an investigation of the ability of our most recent free energy perturbation methodology to model the thermodynamics of protein mutation for two specific problems: protein–protein binding affinities and protein thermal stability. We highlight recent advances in the field and outline current and future challenges.

A scoring protocol based on implicit membrane-based scoring functions and a new protocol for optimizing the positioning of proteins inside the membrane was evaluated for its capacity to discriminate native-like states from misfolded decoys. A decoy set previously established by the Baker lab (Proteins: Struct., Funct., Genet. 2006, 62, 1010–1025) was used along with a second set that was generated to cover higher resolution models. The Implicit Membrane Model 1 (IMM1), IMM1 model with CHARMM 36 parameters (IMM1-p36), generalized Born with simple switching (GBSW), and heterogeneous dielectric generalized Born versions 2 (HDGBv2) and 3 (HDGBv3) were tested along with the new HDGB van der Waals (HDGBvdW) model that adds implicit van der Waals contributions to the solvation free energy. For comparison, scores were also calculated with the distance-scaled finite ideal-gas reference (DFIRE) scoring function. Z-scores for native state discrimination, energy vs root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) correlations, and the ability to select the most native-like structures as top-scoring decoys were evaluated to assess the performance of the scoring functions. Ranking of the decoys in the Baker set that were relatively far from the native state was challenging and dominated largely by packing interactions that were captured best by DFIRE with less benefit of the implicit membrane-based models. Accounting for the membrane environment was much more important in the second decoy set where especially the HDGB-based scoring functions performed very well in ranking decoys and providing significant correlations between scores and RMSD, which shows promise for improving membrane protein structure prediction and refinement applications. The new membrane structure scoring protocol was implemented in the MEMScore web server (http://feiglab.org/memscore).","title: Viral self-assembly pathway and mechanical stress relaxation

abstract:  The final shape of a virus is dictated by the self-assembly pathway of its constituents. Using standard thin-shell elasticity, we highlight the prominent role of the viral shell's spontaneous curvature in determining the assembly pathway. In particular, we demonstrate that the mechanical stress inherent to the growth of a curved surface can be relaxed in two different ways in the early steps of assembly, depending on the value of the spontaneous curvature of the surface. This important result explains why most viral shells have either a compact shape with icosahedral symmetry or an elongated shape lacking this symmetry.

Sculpting organism shape requires that cells produce forces with proper directionality.
 Thus, it is critical to understand how cells orient the cytoskeleton to produce forces that deform tissues. During Drosophila gastrulation, actomyosin contraction in ventral cells generates a long, narrow epithelial furrow, termed the ventral furrow, in which
 actomyosin fibres and tension are directed along the length of the furrow. Using a combination of genetic and mechanical perturbations that alter tissue shape, we demonstrate that geometrical and mechanical constraints act as cues to orient the cytoskeleton
 and tension during ventral furrow formation. We developed an in silico model of two-dimensional actomyosin meshwork contraction, demonstrating that actomyosin meshworks exhibit an inherent force orienting mechanism in response to mechanical constraints. Together,
 our in vivo and in silico data provide a framework for understanding how cells orient force generation, establishing a role for geometrical and mechanical patterning of force production in tissues.

"Title: Jumping between Protein Conformers Using Normal Modes
Authors: Swapnil Mahajan and Yves-Henri Sanejouand
Abstract: The relationship between the normal modes of a protein and its functional conformational change has been studied for decades. However, using this relationship in a predictive context remains a challenge. In this work, we demonstrate that, starting from a given protein conformer, it is possible to generate in a single step model conformers that are less than 1 Å (Cα-RMSD) from the conformer which is the known endpoint of the conformational change, particularly when the conformational change is collective in nature. Such accurate model conformers can be generated by following either the so-called robust or the 50 lowest-frequency modes obtained with various Elastic Network Models (ENMs). Interestingly, the quality of many of these models compares well with actual crystal structures, as assessed by the ROSETTA scoring function and PROCHECK. The most accurate and best quality conformers obtained in the present study were generated by using the 50 lowest-frequency modes of an all-atom ENM. However, with less than ten robust modes, which are identified without any prior knowledge of the nature of the conformational change, nearly 90% of the motion described by the 50 lowest-frequency modes of a protein can be captured. Such results strongly suggest that exploring the robust modes of ENMs may prove efficient for sampling the functionally relevant conformational repertoire of many proteins.

ABSTRACT: Over the past decade, the Rosetta biomolecular modeling suite has informed diverse biological questions and engineering challenges ranging from interpretation of low-resolution structural data to design of nanomaterials, protein therapeutics, and vaccines. Central to Rosetta’s success is the energy function: a model parametrized from small-molecule and X-ray crystal structure data used to approximate the energy associated with each biomolecule conformation. This paper describes the mathematical models and physical concepts that underlie the latest Rosetta energy function, called the Rosetta Energy Function 2015 (REF15). Applying these concepts, we explain how to use Rosetta energies to identify and analyze the features of biomolecular models. Finally, we discuss the latest advances in the energy function that extend its capabilities from soluble proteins to also include membrane proteins, peptides containing noncanonical amino acids, small molecules, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and other macromolecules.","title: Membrane structure formation induced by two types of banana-shaped proteins

authors: H Noguchi  and  J-B Fournier 

journal: Soft Matter, 2017, Accepted Manuscript

abstract:  The assembly of banana-shaped rodlike proteins on membranes, and the associated membrane shape transformations, are investigated by analytical theory and coarse-grained simulations. The membrane-mediated interactions between two banana-shaped inclusions are derived theoretically using a point-like formalism based on fixed anisotropic curvatures, both for zero surface tension and for finite surface tension. On a larger scale, the interactions between assemblies of such rodlike inclusions are determined analytically. Meshless membrane simulations are performed in the presence of a large number of inclusions of two types, corresponding to curved rods of opposite curvatures, both for flat membranes and vesicles. Rods of the same type aggregate into linear assemblies perpendicular to the rod axis, leading to membrane tubulation. However, rods of the other type, those of opposite curvature, are attracted to the lateral sides of these assemblies, and stabilize a straight bump structure that prevents tubulation. When the two types of rods have almost opposite curvatures, the bumps attract one another, forming a stripe structure. Positive surface tension is found to stabilize the stripe formation. The simulation results agree well with the theoretical predictions provided the point-like curvatures of the model are scaled-down to account for the effective flexibility of the simulated rods.","Rules of engagement between αvβ6 integrin and foot-and-mouth disease virus

Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) mediates cell entry by attachment to an integrin receptor,
 generally αvβ6, via a conserved arginine–glycine–aspartic acid (RGD) motif in the exposed, antigenic, GH loop of capsid protein VP1. Infection can also occur in tissue culture adapted virus in the absence of integrin via acquired basic mutations interacting
 with heparin sulphate (HS); this virus is attenuated in natural infections. HS interaction has been visualized at a conserved site in two serotypes suggesting a propensity for sulfated-sugar binding. Here we determined the interaction between αvβ6 and two
 tissue culture adapted FMDV strains by cryo-electron microscopy. In the preferred mode of engagement, the fully open form of the integrin, hitherto unseen at high resolution, attaches to an extended GH loop via interactions with the RGD motif plus downstream
 hydrophobic residues. In addition, an N-linked sugar of the integrin attaches to the previously identified HS binding site, suggesting a functional role.

"Title: Efficiently Sampling Conformations and Pathways Using the Concurrent Adaptive Sampling (CAS) Algorithm
Authors: Surl-Hee Ahn, Jay W. Grate and Eric F. Darve
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are useful in obtaining thermodynamic and kinetic properties of bio-molecules but are limited by the timescale barrier, i.e., we may be unable to efficiently obtain properties because we need to run microseconds or longer simulations using femtoseconds time steps. While there are several existing methods to overcome this timescale barrier and efficiently sample thermodynamic and/or kinetic properties, problems remain in regard to being able to sample unknown systems, deal with high-dimensional space of collective variables, and focus the computational effort on slow timescales. Hence, a new sampling method, called the ""Concurrent Adaptive Sampling (CAS) algorithm,"" has been developed to tackle these three issues and efficiently obtain conformations and pathways. The method is not constrained to use only one or two collective variables, unlike most reaction coordinate-dependent methods. Instead, it can use a large number of collective variables and uses macrostates (a partition of the collective variable space) to enhance the sampling. The exploration is done by running a large number of short simulations, and a clustering technique is used to accelerate the sampling. In this paper, we introduce the new methodology and show results from two-dimensional models and bio-molecules, such as penta-alanine and triazine polymer.

In this contribution, well-converged, microsecond-long free-energy calculations are combined with a recently developed subdiffusive kinetics framework to describe the membrane permeation of a homologous series of short-tail alcohols, from methanol to 1-butanol, with unprecedented fidelity to the underlying molecular models. While the free-energy profiles exhibit barriers for passage through the center of the bilayer in all cases, the height of these barriers decreases with the length of the aliphatic chain of the alcohol, in quantitative agreement with experimentally determined differential solvation free energies in water and oil. A unique aspect of the subdiffusive model employed herein, which was developed in a previous article, is the determination of a position-dependent fractional order which quantifies the degree to which the motion of the alcohol deviates from classical diffusion along the thickness of the membrane. In the aqueous medium far from the bilayer, this quantity approaches 1.0, the asymptotic limit for purely classical diffusion, whereas it dips below 0.75 near the center of the membrane irrespective of the permeant. Remarkably, the fractional diffusivity near the center of membrane, where its influence on the permeability is the greatest, is similar among the four permeants despite the large difference in molecular weight and lipophilicity between methanol and 1-butanol. The relative permeabilities, which are estimated from the free-energy and fractional diffusivity profiles, are therefore determined predominantly by differences in the former rather than the latter. The predicted relative permeabilities are highly correlated with existing experimental results, albeit they do not agree quantitatively with them. On the other hand, quite unexpectedly, the reported experimental values for the short-tail alcohols are nearly three orders of magnitude lower than the available experimental measurement for water. Plausible explanations for this apparent disagreement between theory and experiment are considered in detail.","Title: Control of the hierarchical assembly of π-conjugated optoelectronic peptides by pH and flow
Authors: Rachael A. Mansbach and Andrew L. Ferguson
Abstract: Self-assembled nanoaggregates of p-conjugated peptides possess optoelectronic properties due to electron delocalization over the conjugated peptide groups that make them attractive candidates for the fabrication of bioelectronic materials. We present a computational and theoretical study to resolve the microscopic effects of pH and flow on the non-equilibrium morphology and kinetics of early-stage assembly of an experimentally-realizable optoelectronic peptide that displays pH triggerable assembly. Employing coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we probe the effects of pH on growth kinetics and aggregate morphology to show that control of the peptide protonation state by pH can be used to modulate the assembly rates, degree of molecular alignment, and resulting morphologies within the self-assembling nanoaggregates. We also quantify the time and length scales at which convective flows employed in directed assembly compete with microscopic diffusion to show that flow influences cluster alignment and assembly rate during early-stage assembly only at extremely high shear rates. This suggests that observed improvements in optoelectronic properties at experimentally-accessible shear rates are due to the alignment of large aggregates of hundreds of monomers on time scales in excess of hundreds of nanoseconds. Our work provides new fundamental understanding of the effects of pH and flow to control the morphology and kinetics of early-stage assembly of p-conjugated peptides and lays the groundwork for the rational manipulation of environmental conditions to direct assembly and the attendant emergent optoelectronic properties.

SNARE proteins are the core of the cell’s fusion machinery and mediate virtually all known
 intracellular membrane fusion reactions on which exocytosis and trafficking depend. Fusion is catalyzed when vesicle-associated v-SNAREs form trans-SNARE complexes (“SNAREpins”) with target membrane-associated t-SNAREs, a zippering-like process releasing ∼65
 kT per SNAREpin. Fusion requires several SNAREpins, but how they cooperate is unknown and reports of the number required vary widely. To capture the collective behavior on the long timescales of fusion, we developed a highly coarse-grained model that retains
 key biophysical SNARE properties such as the zippering energy landscape and the surface charge distribution. In simulations the ∼65-kT zippering energy was almost entirely dissipated, with fully assembled SNARE motifs but uncomplexed linker domains. The SNAREpins
 self-organized into a circular cluster at the fusion site, driven by entropic forces that originate in steric–electrostatic interactions among SNAREpins and membranes. Cooperative entropic forces expanded the cluster and pulled the membranes together at the
 center point with high force. We find that there is no critical number of SNAREs required for fusion, but instead the fusion rate increases rapidly with the number of SNAREpins due to increasing entropic forces. We hypothesize that this principle finds physiological
 use to boost fusion rates to meet the demanding timescales of neurotransmission, exploiting the large number of v-SNAREs available in synaptic vesicles. Once in an unfettered cluster, we estimate ≥15 SNAREpins are required for fusion within the ∼1-ms timescale
 of neurotransmitter release.",
"Title: Golgi apparatus self-organizes into the characteristic shape via postmitotic reassembly dynamics
Authors: Masashi Tachikawa and Atsushi Mochizuki
Abstract: The Golgi apparatus is a membrane-bounded organelle with the characteristic shape of a series of stacked flat cisternae. During mitosis in mammalian cells, the Golgi apparatus is once fragmented into small vesicles and then reassembled to form the characteristic shape again in each daughter cell. The mechanism and details of the reassembly process remain elusive. Here, by the physical simulation of a coarse-grained membrane model, we reconstructed the three-dimensional morphological dynamics of the Golgi reassembly process. Considering the stability of the interphase Golgi shape, we introduce two hypothetical mechanisms—the Golgi rim stabilizer protein and curvature-dependent restriction on membrane fusion—into the general biomembrane model. We show that the characteristic Golgi shape is spontaneously organized from the assembly of vesicles by proper tuning of the two additional mechanisms, i.e., the Golgi reassembly process is modeled as self-organization. We also demonstrate that the fine Golgi shape forms via a balance of three reaction speeds: vesicle aggregation, membrane fusion, and shape relaxation. Moreover, the membrane fusion activity decreases thickness and the number of stacked cisternae of the emerging shapes.

ABSTRACT: The generalized energy-based fragmentation (GEBF) method has been applied to investigate relative energies of large water clusters (H2O)n (n = 32, 64) with the coupled-cluster singles and doubles with noniterative triple excitations (CCSD(T)) and second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) at the complete basis set (CBS) limit. Here large water clusters are chosen to be representative structures sampled from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of liquid water. Our calculations show that the GEBF method is capable of providing highly accurate relative energies for these water clusters in a cost-effective way. We demonstrate that the relative energies from GEBF-MP2/CBS are in excellent agreement with those from GEBF-CCSD(T)/CBS for these water clusters. With the GEBF-CCSD(T)/CBS relative energies as the benchmark results, we have assessed the performance of several theoretical methods widely used for ab initio MD simulations of liquids and aqueous solutions. These methods include density functional theory (DFT) with a number of different functionals, MP2, and density functional tight-binding (the third generation, DFTB3 in short). We find that MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ and several DFT methods (such as LC-ωPBE-D3 and ωB97XD) with the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set can provide satisfactory descriptions for these water clusters. Some widely used functionals (such as B3LYP, PBE0) and DFTB3 are not accurate enough for describing the relative energies of large water clusters. Although the basis set dependence of DFT is less than that of ab initio electron correlation methods, we recommend the combination of a few best functionals and large basis sets (at least aug-cc-pVTZ) in theoretical studies on water clusters or aqueous solutions.","Title: Predicting Protein–protein Association Rates using Coarse-grained Simulation and Machine Learning

Authors: Zhong-Ru Xie, Jiawen Chen and Yinghao Wu

Abstract: Protein–protein interactions dominate all major biological processes in living cells. We have developed a new Monte Carlo-based simulation algorithm to study the kinetic process of protein association. We tested our method on a previously used large benchmark set of 49 protein complexes. The predicted rate was overestimated in the benchmark test compared to the experimental results for a group of protein complexes. We hypothesized that this resulted from molecular flexibility at the interface regions of the interacting proteins. After applying a machine learning algorithm with input variables that accounted for both the conformational flexibility and the energetic factor of binding, we successfully identified most of the protein complexes with overestimated association rates and improved our final prediction by using a cross-validation test. This method was then applied to a new independent test set and resulted in a similar prediction accuracy to that obtained using the training set. It has been thought that diffusion-limited protein association is dominated by long-range interactions. Our results provide strong evidence that the conformational flexibility also plays an important role in regulating protein association. Our studies provide new insights into the mechanism of protein association and offer a computationally efficient tool for predicting its rate.

Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels control synaptic neurotransmission by converting chemical
 signals into electrical signals. Agonist binding leads to rapid signal transduction via an allosteric mechanism, where global protein conformational changes open a pore across the nerve cell membrane. We use all-atom molecular dynamics with a swarm-based string
 method to solve for the minimum free-energy gating pathways of the proton-activated bacterial GLIC channel. We describe stable wetted/open and dewetted/closed states, and uncover conformational changes in the agonist-binding extracellular domain, ion-conducting
 transmembrane domain, and gating interface that control communication between these domains. Transition analysis is used to compute free-energy surfaces that suggest allosteric pathways; stabilization with pH; and intermediates, including states that facilitate
 channel closing in the presence of an agonist. We describe a switching mechanism that senses proton binding by marked reorganization of subunit interface, altering the packing of β-sheets to induce changes that lead to asynchronous pore-lining M2 helix movements.
 These results provide molecular details of GLIC gating and insight into the allosteric mechanisms for the superfamily of pentameric ligand-gated channels.

Abstract We perform large scale quantum (path integral) molecular dynamics simulations of a $C_{60}$-like molecule in water. The path integral (PI) technique allows for the description of the delocalization of atoms in space and of its consequences on the structure and dynamics of the hydrogen bonding network around the solute. We then employ the adaptive resolution method GC-AdResS, which unambiguously defines the essential (necessary) degrees of freedom required for a certain property, to analyze the locality of the water structure around the solute. We show that the feature of locality is independent of the use of a quantum or classical model of water. However the water structure around the solute obtained from classical simulations is more ordered and rigid than the structure found in quantum simulations. With this study we mainly intend to show that GC-AdResS, besides its computational efficiency, can be used as a powerful tool of multiscale analysis; this capability, in turn, can be used to speculate about processes at larger scales. We make an example, whose current validity is restricted to the molecular models specifically used, regarding the possible role of quantum effects in the aggregation of fullerene-like molecules in water.

Abstract: Active-matter systems operate far from equilibrium because of the continuous energy injection at the scale of constituent particles. At larger scales, described by coarse-grained models, the global entropy production rate S quantifies the probability ratio of forward and reversed dynamics and hence the importance of irreversibility at such scales: It vanishes whenever the coarse-grained dynamics of the active system reduces to that of an effective equilibrium model. We evaluate S for a class of scalar stochastic field theories describing the coarse-grained density of self-propelled particles without alignment interactions, capturing such key phenomena as motility-induced phase separation. We show how the entropy production can be decomposed locally (in real space) or spectrally (in Fourier space), allowing detailed examination of the spatial structure and correlations that underly departures from equilibrium. For phase-separated systems, the local entropy production is concentrated mainly on interfaces, with a bulk contribution that tends to zero in the weak-noise limit. In homogeneous states, we find a generalized Harada-Sasa relation that directly expresses the entropy production in terms of the wave-vector-dependent deviation from the fluctuation-dissipation relation between response functions and correlators. We discuss extensions to the case where the particle density is coupled to a momentum-conserving solvent and to situations where the particle current, rather than the density, should be chosen as the dynamical field. We expect the new conceptual tools developed here to be broadly useful in the context of active matter, allowing one to distinguish when and where activity plays an essential role in the dynamics.
 

","Title: Kinematics of the lever arm swing in myosin VI

Authors: Mauro L. Mugnai and D. Thirumalai

Abstract: Myosin VI (MVI) is the only known member of the myosin superfamily that, upon dimerization, walks processively toward the pointed end of the actin filament. The leading head of the dimer directs the trailing head forward with a power stroke, a conformational change of the motor domain exaggerated by the lever arm. Using a unique coarse-grained model for the power stroke of a single MVI, we provide the molecular basis for its motility. We show that the power stroke occurs in two major steps. First, the motor domain attains the poststroke conformation without directing the lever arm forward; and second, the lever arm reaches the poststroke orientation by undergoing a rotational diffusion. From the analysis of the trajectories, we discover that the potential that directs the rotating lever arm toward the poststroke conformation is almost flat, implying that the lever arm rotation is mostly uncoupled from the motor domain. Because a backward load comparable to the largest interhead tension in a MVI dimer prevents the rotation of the lever arm, our model suggests that the leading-head lever arm of a MVI dimer is uncoupled, in accord with the inference drawn from polarized total internal reflection fluorescence (polTIRF) experiments. Without any adjustable parameter, our simulations lead to quantitative agreement with polTIRF experiments, which validates the structural insights. Finally, in addition to making testable predictions, we also discuss the implications of our model in explaining the broad step-size distribution of the MVI stepping pattern.

Transcriptional regulation allows cells to match their gene expression profiles to their
 current requirements based on environment, cellular physiological state, and extracellular signals. DNA binding transcription factors are major agents of transcriptional regulation, and bind to DNA with a factor-specific sequence preference to exert regulatory
 effects. A crucial step in unraveling the logic of a regulatory network is determining the sequence-specific binding affinity landscapes for the transcription factors in it. While such landscapes can be measured experimentally, the ability to predict them
 computationally would both reduce the effort required to obtain the needed data and provide additional insight into the key interactions shaping protein–DNA interactions. Here we apply free energy calculations based on all-atom molecular dynamics simulations
 to predict the changes in binding free energy for all single base pair perturbations of the binding sites for four eukaryotic transcription factors for which high-quality experimental data exist. We find that the simulated results both vastly overestimate
 the magnitude of changes in binding free energy, and frequently predict the incorrect signs. These simulations will nevertheless serve as a jumping-off point for refining our current representation of protein–DNA interactions to allow quantitative reproduction
 of experimental data on such systems in the future.

Abstract Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are useful in obtaining thermodynamic and kinetic properties of bio-molecules but are limited by the timescale barrier, i.e., we may be unable to efficiently obtain properties because we need to run microseconds or longer simulations using femtoseconds time steps. While there are several existing methods to overcome this timescale barrier and efficiently sample thermodynamic and/or kinetic properties, problems remain in regard to being able to sample unknown systems, deal with high-dimensional space of collective variables, and focus the computational effort on slow timescales. Hence, a new sampling method, called the “Concurrent Adaptive Sampling (CAS) algorithm,” has been developed to tackle these three issues and efficiently obtain conformations and pathways. The method is not constrained to use only one or two collective variables, unlike most reaction coordinate-dependent methods. Instead, it can use a large number of collective variables and uses macrostates (a partition of the collective variable space) to enhance the sampling. The exploration is done by running a large number of short simulations, and a clustering technique is used to accelerate the sampling. In this paper, we introduce the new methodology and show results from two-dimensional models and bio-molecules, such as penta-alanine and triazine polymer. ","L. Sapir and D.

Abstract:In processes involving aqueous solutions and in almost every biomolecular interaction, hydrogen bonds play important roles. Though weak compared to the covalent bond, hydrogen bonds modify the stability and conformation of numerous small and large molecules and modulate their intermolecular interactions. We propose a simple methodology for extracting hydrogen bond strength from atomistic level simulations. The free energy associated with hydrogen bond formation is conveniently calculated as the reversible work required to reshape a completely random pair probability distribution reference state into the one found in simulations where hydrogen bonds are formed. Requiring only the probability density distribution of donor-acceptor pairs in the first solvation shell of an electronegative atom, the method uniquely defines the free energy, entropy, and enthalpy of the hydrogen bond. The method can be easily extended to molecules other than water, and to multiple component mixtures. We demonstrate and apply this methodology to hydrogen bonds that form between water molecules, as well as to bonds formed in molecular dynamics simulations between a sugar (trehalose) and water in binary mixtures. Finally, we comment on how the method should be useful in assessing the role of hydrogen bonds in different molecular mechanisms.

The SCC-DFTB/MIO/CHARMM free energy surface for a glycosyltransferase, TcTS, is benchmarked against a DFT/MM reaction trajectory using the same CHARMM MM force field ported to the NWChem package. The popular B3LYP functional, against which the MIO parameter set was parameterized is used to optimize TS structures and run DFT reaction dynamics. A novel approach was used to generate reaction forces from a SCC-DFTB/MIO/CHARMM reaction surface to drive B3LYP/6-31G/MM and B3LYP/6-31G(d)/MM reaction trajectories. Although TS structures compare favorably, differences stemming primarily from a minimal basis set approximation prevented a successful 6-31G(d) FEARCF reaction dynamics trajectory. None the less, the dynamic evolution of the B3LYP/6-31G/MM-computed electron density provided an opportunity to perform NBO analysis along the reaction trajectory. Here, we illustrate that a successful ab initio reaction trajectory is computationally accessible when the underlying potential energy function of the semi-empirical method used to produce driving forces is sufficiently close to the ab initio potential.

Abstract: The development of rapid methods to explain and predict peptide interactions, aggregation, and self-assembly has become important to understanding amyloid disease pathology, the shelf stability of peptide therapeutics, and the design of novel peptide materials. While experimental aggregation databases have been used to develop correlative and statistical models, molecular simulations offer atomic-level details that potentially provide greater physical insight and allow one to single out the most explanatory simple models. Here, we outline one such approach using a case study that develops homodimerization models for serine-glycine peptides with various hydrophobic leucine mutations. Using detailed all-atom simulations, we calculate reference dimerization free energy profiles and binding constants for a small peptide library. We then use statistical methods to systematically assess whether simple interaction models – that do not require expensive simulations and free energy calculation – can capture them. Surprisingly, some combinations of a few simple scaling laws well-recapitulate the detailed, all-atom results with high accuracy. Specifically, we find that a recently-proposed phenomenological hydrophobic force law and coarse measures of entropic effects in binding offer particularly high explanatory power, underscoring the physical relevance to association that these driving forces can play.

Abstract Self-assembly of peptide amphiphiles (PAs) has been an active research area as the assemblies can be programmed into variously shaped nanostructures. Although cylindrical micelles are common structures, gold-binding peptide conjugates can self-assemble into chiral nanofibers with single or double helices. When gold nanoparticles bind to the helices, the resulting chiral nanoparticle assemblies have a collective plasmonic circular dichroism signal that can serve as nanoscale circular polarizers or chiroptical sensors. A better atomic-level understanding of the factors which lead to helical PA assemblies is therefore of significant importance. In this study we show that all-atom molecular dynamics simulations can describe the spontaneous structural transformation from a planar assembly of PAs to a twisted assembly or to a helical ribbon. The twist angle and the helical diameter calculated from the simulations closely match the experimental results, with the oxidation of a single Met residue in each PA leading to a change from bilayer to monolayer assemblies with significantly different ribbon properties. A secondary structure analysis shows how a combination of β-sheet formation near the hydrophobic core of the micelle and PPII structures from proline-rich C-terminus regions favors helix formation. The simulations presented here demonstrate the capability of predicting self-assembly in chiral structures, protocols that can easily be applied to the assembly of other amphiphilic molecules.

Abstract:One emerging approach for the fabrication of complex architectures on the nanoscale is to utilize particles customized to intrinsically self-assemble into a desired structure. Inverse methods of statistical mechanics have proven particularly effective for the discovery of interparticle interactions suitable for this aim. Here we evaluate the generality and robustness of a recently introduced inverse design strategy [B. A. Lindquist et al., J. Chem. Phys. 145, 111101 (2016)] by applying this simulation-based machine learning method to optimize for interparticle interactions that  self-assemble particles into a variety of complex microstructures as follows: cluster fluids, porous mesophases, and crystalline lattices. Using the method, we discover isotropic pair  interactionsthat lead to the self-assembly of each of the desired morphologies, including several types of potentials that were not previously understood to be capable of stabilizing such systems. One such pair potential led to the assembly of the highly asymmetric truncated trihexagonal lattice and another produced a fluid containing spherical voids, or pores, of designed size via purely repulsive interactions. Through these examples, we demonstrate several advantages inherent to this particular design approach including the use of a parametrized functional form for the optimized interparticle interactions, the ability to constrain the range of said parameters, and compatibility of the inverse design strategy with a variety of simulation protocols (e.g., positional restraints).

","Evaluating solvation entropies directly and combining with direct energy calculations is one way of calculating free energies of solvation and is used by Inhomogeneous Fluid Solvation Theory (IFST). The configurational entropy of a fluid is a function of the interatomic correlations and can thus be expressed in terms of correlation functions. The entropies in this work are directly calculated from a truncated series of integrals over these correlation functions. Many studies truncate all terms higher than the solvent-solute correlations. This study includes an additional solvent-solvent correlation term and assesses the associated free energy when IFST is applied to a fixed Lennard-Jones particle solvated in neon. The strength of the central potential is varied to imitate larger solutes. Average free energy estimates with both levels of IFST are able to reproduce the estimate made using the Free energy Perturbation (FEP) to within 0.16 kcal/mol. We find that the signal from the solvent-solvent correlations is very weak. Our conclusion is that for monatomic fluids simulated by pairwise classical potentials the correction term is relatively small in magnitude. This study shows it is possible to reproduce the free energy from a path based method like FEP, by only considering the endpoints of the path. This method can be directly applied to more complex solutes which break the spherical symmetry of this study.

Abstract: We combine classical and ring polymer molecular dynamics simulations with the molecular jump model to provide a molecular description of the nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) on water reorientation and hydrogen-bond dynamics in liquid H2O and D2O. We show that while the net NQEs is negligible in D2O, it leads to a ∼13% acceleration in H2O dynamics compared to a classical description. Large angular jumps exchanging hydrogen-bond partners are the dominant reorientation pathway (just as in a classical description); the faster reorientation dynamics arise from the increased jump rate constant. NQEs do not change the jump amplitude distribution and no significant tunneling is found. The faster jump dynamics are quantitatively related to decreased structuring of the OO radial distribution function when NQEs are included. This is explained, via a jump model analysis, by a competition between the effects of water’s librational and OH stretch mode zero point energies on the hydrogen-bond strength.

Abstract A generally applicable metadynamics scheme for predicting the free-energy profile of ligand binding to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) is described. A common collective variable (CV) can be defined because of the orientation of GPCRs in the cell membrane and because the relatively fixed residue Trp6.48 is highly conserved in GPCRs. Using this single CV together with well-tempered multiple-walker metadynamics with a funnel-like constraint allows an efficient exploration of the entire ligand-binding path from the extracellular medium to the orthosteric binding site, including vestibule and intermediate sites. The protocol can be used with X-ray structures or well equilibrated homology models for the receptor and is universally applicable to agonists, antagonists, partial and reverse agonists. The root mean square error (RMSE) in predicted binding free energies for 12 diverse ligands in five receptors (a total of 23 data points) is surprisingly small (less than 1 kcal mol-1). The RMSEs for simulations that use receptor X-ray structures and homology models are 0.6 and 1.1 kcal mol-1, respectively.

Abstract: Long-range ion induced water-water correlations were recently observed in femtosecond elastic second harmonic scattering experiments of electrolytesolutions. To further the qualitative understanding of these correlations, we derive an analytical expression that quantifies ion induced dipole-dipole correlations in a non-interacting gas of dipoles. This model is a logical extension of the Debye-Hückel theory that can be used to qualitatively understand how the combined electric field of the ions induces correlations in the orientational distributions of the water molecules in an aqueous solution. The model agrees with the results from molecular dynamics simulations and provides an important starting point for further theoretical work."," Bayesian-based methodology is developed to estimate diffusion tensors from molecular dynamics simulations of permeants in anisotropic media, and is applied to oxygen in lipid bilayers. By a separation of variables in the Smoluchowski diffusion equation, the multidimensional diffusion is reduced to coupled one-dimensional diffusion problems that are treated by discretization. The resulting diffusivity profiles characterize the membrane transport dynamics as a function of the position across the membrane, discriminating between diffusion normal and parallel to the membrane. The methodology is first validated with neat water, neat hexadecane, and a hexadecane slab surrounded by water, the latter being a simple model for a lipid membrane. Next, a bilayer consisting of pure 1-palmitoyl 2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC), and a bilayer mimicking the lipid composition of the inner mitochondrial membrane, including cardiolipin, are investigated. We analyze the detailed time evolution of oxygen molecules, in terms of both normal diffusion through and radial diffusion inside the membrane. Diffusion is fast in the more loosely packed interleaflet region, and anisotropic, with oxygen spreading more rapidly in the membrane plane than normal to it. Visualization of the propagator shows that oxygen enters the membrane rapidly, reaching its thermodynamically favored center in about 1 ns, despite the free energy barrier at the headgroup region. Oxygen transport is quantified by computing the oxygen permeability of the membranes and the average radial diffusivity, which confirm the anisotropy of the diffusion. The position-dependent diffusion constants and free energies are used to construct compartmental models and test assumptions used in estimating permeability, including Overton’s rule. In particular, a hexadecane slab surrounded by water is found to be a poor model of oxygen transport in membranes because the relevant energy barriers differ substantially.

What Makes a Density Functional Approximation Good? Insights from the Left Fukui Function
Tim Gould Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation Article ASAP DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00231
This work proposes, justifies, and reports tests of the chemically relevant left Fukui function of Li, C, and F on a range of density functional approximations. Analysis indicates that functionals can be good at densities and bad at Fukui functions, and vice versa, analogous with energies and ionization potentials. “TPSSh”, “SOGGA11X”, and “B2PLYP” are star performers on both, however. Many “Minnesota functionals” fare much better here than in a recent analysis of electron densities. In this context, new optimizing strategies are mentioned.

Abstract: We derive the hydrodynamic equations of motion for a fluid of active particles described by underdamped Langevin equations that reduce to the active-Brownian-particle model, in the overdamped limit. The contraction into the hydrodynamic description is performed by locally averaging the particle dynamics with the nonequilibrium many-particle probability density, whose formal expression is found in the physically relevant limit of high friction through a multiple-time-scale analysis. This approach permits us to identify the conditions under which self-propulsion can be subsumed into the fluid stress tensor and thus to define systematically and unambiguously the local pressure of the active fluid.",

Abstract Referring to the optimization algorithm previously developed for atomic clusters, the present author develops an efficient method for geometry optimization of a coarse-grained protein model expressed with two kinds of beads (hydrophilic and hydrophobic ones). In the method, two types of geometrical perturbations, center-directed bead move and one bead rotation, are used to explore new configurations and local optimizations are performed after the perturbations. The center-directed bead move is used for hydrophobic beads and the one bead rotation is performed for both hydrophobic and hydrophilic beads. The optimization method was applied to protein models consisting of 13, 20, 21, and 34 beads. The present method produced the global minima of the 13-, 21-, and 34-bead models reported in the literature and updated the lowest energies of the protein models with 20 beads. These results indicate that the present method is efficient for searching for optimal structures of proteins.    ","Self Consistent Path Sampling: Making Accurate All-Atom Protein Folding

","Accurate Relative Energies and Binding Energies of Large Ice–Liquid Water Clusters and Periodic Structures

Relative energies and binding energies are crucial quantities that determine various molecular properties of ice and water. We developed a new effective method to compute those energies of bulk ice–liquid water systems. In this work, ten ice–liquid 144-mers and ten periodic ice–liquid (H2O)64 systems are taken from the molecular dynamics simulations in the melting process of ice-Ih crystals. They are investigated at the levels of density functional theory (DFT), explicitly correlated second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory (MP2-F12), and coupled-cluster singles and doubles with noniterative triples corrections [CCSD(T)-F12b] in the framework of generalized energy-based fragmentation approach. Our results show that the changing of noncovalent interactions significantly influences the performances of DFT and electron correlation methods for those systems in the melting process of ice. Various DFT methods predict quite different results for ice and mixed ice–liquid structures but give similar results for pure liquid ones. It also explains why many DFT-based simulations lead to inaccurate densities of ice and liquid water. The CCSD(T)-F12b results suggest that the MP2-F12 method provides satisfactory results and is expected to be employed to simulate the phase transitions of ice crystal.

The distinctive viscoelastic behavior of polymers results from a coupled interplay of motion on multiple length and time scales. Capturing the broad time and length scales of polymer motion remains a challenge. Using polyethylene (PE) as a model macromolecule, we construct coarse-grained (CG) models of PE with 3-6 methyl groups per CG bead and probe two critical aspects of the technique: pressure corrections required after iterative Boltzmann inversion (IBI) to generate CG potentials that match the pressure of reference fully-atomistic melt simulations and the transferability of CG potentials across temperatures. While IBI produces nonbonded pair potentials which give excellent agreement between the atomistic and CG pair correlation functions, the resulting pressure for the CG models is large compared to the pressure of the atomistic system.We find that correcting the potential to match the reference pressure leads to non-bonded interactions with much deeper minima and slightly smaller effective bead diameter. However, simulations with potentials generated by both IBI and pressure-corrected IBI result in similar mean-squared displacement (MSD) and stress auto correlation functions G(t) for PE melts. While the time rescaling factor required to match CG and atomistic models is the same for pressure and non-pressure corrected CG models, it strongly depends on temperature. Transferability was investigated by comparing the MSD and G(t) for potentials developed at different temperatures.",

Mechanochemical mechanism of integrin clustering modulated by nanoscale ligand spacing and rigidity of extracellular substrates.
Yu J, Huang J, Jansen JA, Xiong C, Walboomers XF
Abstract. Experimental findings indicate that cell function and behavior such as cell growth, division, migration and differentiation, are subtly regulated via integrin-dependent cell adhesion. Cell adhesion is influenced by nanoscale ligand spacing and rigidity of extracellular substrates, as cell adhesion drops greatly when the ligand spacing is larger than ~60nm, and cell adhesion is stronger on stiff than soft substrates. However, how nanoscale ligand spacing and substrate stiffness jointly affect integrin clustering and hence nascent cell adhesion remains to be elucidated. To quantitatively investigate the phenomena and the underlying mechanochemical mechanism of integrin clustering modulated by ligand spacing and substrate stiffness, we introduced Monte Carlo simulations varying the values of ligand spacing and substrate stiffness. Moreover, the effects of integrin number, integrin binding free energy, integrin association free energy, and local ligand spacing were investigated. The simulation results showed that integrin clustering decreased sharply, when ligand spacing was relatively large such as dL>60nm in the current simulations, regardless of substrate rigidities, though with close spacing, the clustering increased with the substrate stiffness. The investigation contributes to the goals of understanding and predicting experimental phenomena, directing and optimizing biomaterial design, and manipulating integrin-dependent cell-substrate adhesion in tissue engineering.

Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels control synaptic neurotransmission by converting chemical signals into electrical signals. Agonist binding leads to rapid signal transduction via an allosteric mechanism, where global protein conformational changes open a pore across the nerve cell membrane. We use all-atom molecular dynamics with a swarm-based string method to solve for the minimum free-energy gating pathways of the proton-activated bacterial GLIC channel. We describe stable wetted/open and dewetted/closed states, and uncover conformational changes in the agonist-binding extracellular domain, ion-conducting transmembrane domain, and gating interface that control communication between these domains. Transition analysis is used to compute free-energy surfaces that suggest allosteric pathways; stabilization with pH; and intermediates, including states that facilitate channel closing in the presence of an agonist. We describe a switching mechanism that senses proton binding by marked reorganization of subunit interface, altering the packing of β-sheets to induce changes that lead to asynchronous pore-lining M2 helix movements. These results provide molecular details of GLIC gating and insight into the allosteric mechanisms for the superfamily of pentameric ligand-gated channels.

A multiscale biomechanical model of platelets: Correlating with in-vitro results.
Zhang P, Zhang L, Slepian MJ, Deng Y, Bluestein D.
Abstract. Using dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) combined with coarse grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) approaches, we developed a multiscale deformable platelet model to accurately describe the molecular-scale intra-platelet constituents and biomechanical properties of platelets in blood flow. Our model includes the platelet bilayer membrane, cytoplasm and an elaborate elastic cytoskeleton. Correlating numerical simulations with published in-vitro experiments, we validated the biorheology of the cytoplasm, the elastic response of membrane to external stresses, and the stiffness of the cytoskeleton actin filaments, resulting in an accurate representation of the molecular-level biomechanical microstructures of platelets. This enabled us to study the mechanotransduction process of the hemodynamic stresses acting onto the platelet membrane and transmitted to these intracellular constituents. The platelets constituents continuously deform in response to the flow induced stresses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first molecular-scale platelet model that can be used to accurately predict platelets activation mechanism leading to thrombus formation in prosthetic cardiovascular devices and in vascular disease processes. This model can be further employed to study the effects of novel therapeutic approaches of modulating platelet properties to enhance their shear resistance via mechanotransduction pathways.

SNARE proteins are the core of the cell’s fusion machinery and mediate virtually all known intracellular membrane fusion reactions on which exocytosis and trafficking depend. Fusion is catalyzed when vesicle-associated v-SNAREs form trans-SNARE complexes (“SNAREpins”) with target membrane-associated t-SNAREs, a zippering-like process releasing ∼65 kT per SNAREpin. Fusion requires several SNAREpins, but how they cooperate is unknown and reports of the number required vary widely. To capture the collective behavior on the long timescales of fusion, we developed a highly coarse-grained model that retains key biophysical SNARE properties such as the zippering energy landscape and the surface charge distribution. In simulations the ∼65-kT zippering energy was almost entirely dissipated, with fully assembled SNARE motifs but uncomplexed linker domains. The SNAREpins self-organized into a circular cluster at the fusion site, driven by entropic forces that originate in steric–electrostatic interactions among SNAREpins and membranes. Cooperative entropic forces expanded the cluster and pulled the membranes together at the center point with high force. We find that there is no critical number of SNAREs required for fusion, but instead the fusion rate increases rapidly with the number of SNAREpins due to increasing entropic forces. We hypothesize that this principle finds physiological use to boost fusion rates to meet the demanding timescales of neurotransmission, exploiting the large number of v-SNAREs available in synaptic vesicles. Once in an unfettered cluster, we estimate ≥15 SNAREpins are required for fusion within the ∼1-ms timescale of neurotransmitter release.",

The interplay between the intracellular gate and the selectivity filter underlies the structural
 basis for gating in potassium ion channels. Using a combination of protein semisynthesis, two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we probe the ion occupancy at the S1 binding site in the constricted state of
 the selectivity filter of the KcsA channel when the intracellular gate is open and closed. The 2D IR spectra resolve two features, whose relative intensities depend on the state of the intracellular gate. By matching the experiment to calculated 2D IR spectra
 of structures predicted by MD simulations, we identify the two features as corresponding to states with S1 occupied or unoccupied by K+. We learn that S1 is >70% occupied when the intracellular gate is closed and <15% occupied when the gate is open. Comparison
 of MD trajectories show that opening of the intracellular gate causes a structural change in the selectivity filter, which leads to a change in the ion occupancy. This work reveals the complexity of the conformational landscape of the K+ channel selectivity
 filter and its dependence on the state of the intracellular gate.

Investigations of FAK Inhibitors: A Combination of 3D-QSAR, Docking and Molecular Dynamics Simulations Studies.

Abstract. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is one kind of tyrosine kinases that modulates integrin and growth factor signaling pathways, which is a promising therapeutic target because of involving in cancer cell migration, proliferation and survival. To investigate the mechanism between FAK and triazinic inhibitors and design high activity inhibitors, a molecular modeling integrated with 3D-QSAR, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations and binding free energy calculations was performed. The optimum CoMFA and CoMSIA modeles showed good reliability and satisfactory predictability (with Q2=0.663, R2=0.987, R2pred=0.921 and Q2=0.670, R2=0.981, R2pred=0.953). Its contour maps could provide structural features to improve inhibitory activity. Furthermore, a good consistency between contour maps, docking and molecular dynamics simulations strongly demonstrates that the molecular modeling is reliable. Based on it, we designed several new compounds and their inhibitory activities were validated by the molecular models. We expect our studies could bring new ideas to promote the development of novel inhibitors with higher inhibitory activity for FAK.

A scoring protocol based on implicit membrane-based scoring functions and a new protocol
 for optimizing the positioning of proteins inside the membrane was evaluated for its capacity to discriminate native-like states from misfolded decoys. A decoy set previously established by the Baker lab (Proteins: Struct., Funct., Genet. 2006, 62, 1010–1025)
 was used along with a second set that was generated to cover higher resolution models. The Implicit Membrane Model 1 (IMM1), IMM1 model with CHARMM 36 parameters (IMM1-p36), generalized Born with simple switching (GBSW), and heterogeneous dielectric generalized
 Born versions 2 (HDGBv2) and 3 (HDGBv3) were tested along with the new HDGB van der Waals (HDGBvdW) model that adds implicit van der Waals contributions to the solvation free energy. For comparison, scores were also calculated with the distance-scaled finite
 ideal-gas reference (DFIRE) scoring function. Z-scores for native state discrimination, energy vs root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) correlations, and the ability to select the most native-like structures as top-scoring decoys were evaluated to assess the performance
 of the scoring functions. Ranking of the decoys in the Baker set that were relatively far from the native state was challenging and dominated largely by packing interactions that were captured best by DFIRE with less benefit of the implicit membrane-based
 models. Accounting for the membrane environment was much more important in the second decoy set where especially the HDGB-based scoring functions performed very well in ranking decoys and providing significant correlations between scores and RMSD, which shows
 promise for improving membrane protein structure prediction and refinement applications. The new membrane structure scoring protocol was implemented in the MEMScore web server (http://feiglab.org/memscore).

Replica-exchange enveloping distribution sampling (RE-EDS) allows the efficient estimation of free-energy differences between multiple end-states from a single molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. In EDS, a reference state is sampled, which can be tuned by two kinds of parameters, i.e. smoothness parameters(s) and energy offsets, such that all end-states are sufficiently sampled. The choice of these parameters is, however, not trivial. Replica exchange (RE) or parallel tempering is a widely applied technique to enhance sampling. By combining EDS with the RE technique, the parameter choice problem could be simplified and the challenge shifted towards an optimal distribution of the replicas in the smoothness-parameter space. The choice of a certain replica distribution can alter the sampling efficiency significantly. In this work, global round- trip time optimisation (GRTO) algorithms are tested for the use in RE-EDS simulations. In addition, a local round-trip time optimisation (LRTO) algorithm is proposed for systems with slowly adapting environments, where a reliable estimate for the round- trip time is challenging to obtain. The optimisation algorithms were applied to RE-EDS simulations of a system of nine small-molecule inhibitors of phenylethanolamine N -methyltransferase (PNMT). The energy offsets were determined using the recently proposed parallel energy-offset (PEOE) estimation scheme. While multi-state GRTO algorithm yielded the best replica distribution for the ligands in water, the multi-state LRTO algorithm was found to be the method of choice for the ligands in complex with PNMT. With this, the 36 alchemical free-energy differences between the nine ligands were calculated successfully from a single RE-EDS simulation of 10 ns length.

λ-dynamics is a generalized ensemble method for alchemical free energy calculations. In traditional λ-dynamics, the alchemical switch variable λ is treated as a continuous variable ranging from 0 to 1 and an empirical estimator (∆Gˆ = −β−1ln[P(λ > λcutoff)/P (λ < 1−λcutoff)]) is utilized to approximate the free energy (∆G = −β−1ln[P (λ = 1)/P(λ = 0)]) based on λ trajectories, where the cutoff value of λcutoff is empirically chosen to be near 1. In the present paper, we describe an alternative formulation of λ-dynamics that utilizes the Gibbs sampler framework which we call Gibbs Sampler λ-dynamics (GSLD). In GSLD, λ can be discrete or continuous. When λ is continuous, GSLD, like traditional λ-dynamics, can be readily extended to calculate free energy differences between multiple ligands in one simulation. We also introduce a new free energy estimator, the Rao-Blackwell estimator (RBE) for use in conjunction with GSLD or other λ-dynamics based methods. Compared with the current empirical estimator, RBE has two advantages. The first advantage is that RBE is an unbiased estimator that does not depend on the cutoff value λcutoff. The other advantage is that the vari- ance of RBE is usually smaller than the current empirical estimator. We also show that RBE is a continuous generalization of the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio (MBAR) method or the unbinned weighted histogram analysis method (UWHAM), as RBE reduces to the MBAR/UWHAM equations when it is applied to the case where λ is discrete. We illustrate the use and performance of this new free energy computational framework by application to a simple harmonic system as well as relevant calculations of small molecule relative free energies of solvation and binding to a protein recep- tor. Our findings demonstrate consistent and improved performance compared with conventional alchemical free energy methods.",,

Hydronium (H3O+) and hydroxide (OH-) ions have anomalously large diffusion constants in aqueous solutions due to their combination of vehicular and Grotthuss hopping diffusion mechanisms. An improvement of ReaxFF reactive water force field on the basis of our previous first-generation ReaxFF water force field (water-2010) is presented to describe the proton transfer (PT) mechanisms of H3O+ and OH- in water. Molecular dynamics simulation studies with water-2017 force field support the Eigen-Zundel-Eigen mechanism for PT in acidic aqueous solution and reproduce the hyper-coordinated solvation structure of the OH- in basic environment. In particular, it predicts the correct order of the diffusion constants of H2O, H3O+ and OH- and their values are in agreement with the experimental data. Another interesting observation is that the diffusion constants of H3O+ and OH- are close to each other at the high concentration due to the strong correlation between OH- ions in basic aqueous solution. Based on our results, it is shown that ReaxFF provides a novel approach to study the complex acid-base chemical reactions in aqueous solution with any pH value.

Abstract: Solvation is a fundamental driving force in many biological processes including biomolecular recognition and self-assembly, not to mention protein folding, dynamics, and function. The Variational Implicit Solvent Method (VISM) is a theoretical tool currently developed and optimized to estimate solvation free energies for systems of very complex topology, such as biomolecules. VISM’s theoretical framework makes it unique because it couples hydrophobic, van der Waals and electrostatic interactions as a functional of the solvation interface. By minimizing this functional, VISM produces the solvation interface as an output of the theory. In this work, we push VISM to larger scale applications by combining it with coarse-grained solute Hamiltonians adapted from the MARTINI framework, a well-established meso-scale force field for modeling large-scale biomolecule assemblies. We show how MARTINI-VISM (MVISM) compares with atomistic VISM (AVISM) for a small set of proteins differing in size, shape and charge distribution. We also demonstrate MVISM’s suitability to study the solvation properties of an interesting encounter complex, barnase-barstar. The promising results suggest that coarse-graining the protein with the MARTINI force field is indeed a valuable step to broaden VISM’s and MARTINI’s applications in the near future.

ABSTRACT: Glutamine synthetase (GS) is a crucial enzyme responsible for the elimination of both neurotoxic glutamate and toxic ammonium, by combining them into glutamine. Alterations on the GS activity are associated with severe liver and neurodegenerative diseases and its absence or malformation results in death. In this work, the catalytic mechanism of human GS has been investigated with high-level QM/MM calculations, showing a two-phase reaction cycle. During phase 1, GS activates the reactants (NH4+ and glutamate) with extreme efficiency, through NH4+ deprotonation by E305 and glutamate phosphorylation by ATP, in two spontaneous and barrierless reactions. At phase 2, NH3 attacks the γ-glutamyl phosphate being concomitantly deprotonated by the leaving PO43-, forming the glutamine and HPO42- products. The second phase contains the rate limiting step, with a ΔG‡ of 19.2 kcal·mol-1 associated to the nucleophilic substitution of the phosphate by NH3. The final reaction free energy is -34.5 kcal·mol-1. Both phases are exergonic, the first by -22.9 kcal·mol-1 and the second by -11.6 kcal·mol-1. Direct NH4+ attack is shown to be inefficient; the possible bases that perform the NH4+ deprotonation were systematically investigated. Negative E305 was shown to be the only one possibly responsible for NH4+ deprotonation. Altogether these results provide a clear atomic level picture of the reaction cycle of GS, consistent with experimental and theoretical studies on GS of this and other organisms, and provide the necessary insights for the development of more specific therapeutic GS inhibitors.","Stelzl, L.

Transitions between metastable states govern many fundamental processes in physics, chemistry, and biology, from nucleation events in phase transitions to the folding of proteins. The free energy surfaces underlying these processes can be obtained from simulations using enhanced sampling methods. However, their altered dynamics makes kinetic and mechanistic information difficult or impossible to extract. Here we show that with replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD), one can not only sample equilibrium properties, but also extract kinetic information. For systems that strictly obey first-order kinetics, the procedure to extract rates is rigorous. For actual molecular systems whose long-time dynamics is captured by kinetic rate models, accurate rate coefficients can be determined from the statistics of the transitions between the metastable states at each replica temperatures. We demonstrate the practical applicability of the procedure by constructing master equation (Markov state) models of peptide and RNA folding from REMD simulations."

The nonpolarizable force field was also optimized for comparison. The AMOEBA force field was found to give a more accurate hydration free energy than the nonpolarizable force field with respect to experimental data, and correctly predict the most stable electronic state of hydrated Fe3+, which is the sextet state, and of the Fe(III)–Por complex, which is the quartet state, consistent with the literature that was carried out using the DFT method. The explicit inclusion of charge transfer between Fe3+ and ligand was found to be important in order to obtain a precise picture of polarization energy and van der Waals energy, which otherwise deviate from the corresponding energy components derived from ab initio calculations. The successful application of the AMOEBA force field in the characterization of aquo Fe(III)–Por complexes suggests that its use may be extended to the study of the dynamics of metalloenzyme containing highly charged metal ions in the condensed phase with reliable treatment of the interactions between metal atom and protein.","C.

Unravelling the influence of quantum proton delocalization on electronic charge transfer through the hydrogen bond, Chem. Phys. Lett., 676, 289-295 (2017)

Abstract: Upon hydrogen bond formation, electronic charge density is transferred between the donor and acceptor, impacting processes ranging from hydration to spectroscopy. Here we use ab initio path integral simulations to elucidate the role of nuclear quantum effects in determining the charge transfer in a range of hydrogen bonded species in the gas and liquid phase. We show that the quantization of the nuclei gives rise to large changes in the magnitude of the charge transfer as well as its temperature dependence. We then explain how a single geometric parameter determines the charge transfer through the hydrogen bond. These results thus demonstrate that nuclear quantum effects are vital for the accurate description of charge transfer and offer a physically transparent way to understand how hydrogen bonding gives rise to it.","Complete protein–protein association kinetics in atomic detail revealed by molecular dynamics simulations and Markov modelling

Journal: Nature Chemistry (2017) doi:10.1038/nchem.2785

Abstract: Protein–protein association is fundamental to many life processes. However, a microscopic model describing the structures and kinetics during association and dissociation is lacking on account of the long lifetimes of associated states, which have prevented efficient sampling by direct molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Here we demonstrate protein–protein association and dissociation in atomistic resolution for the ribonuclease barnase and its inhibitor barstar by combining adaptive high-throughput MD simulations and hidden Markov modelling. The model reveals experimentally consistent intermediate structures, energetics and kinetics on timescales from microseconds to hours. A variety of flexibly attached intermediates and misbound states funnel down to a transition state and a native basin consisting of the loosely bound near-native state and the tightly bound crystallographic state. These results offer a deeper level of insight into macromolecular recognition and our approach opens the door for understanding and manipulating a wide range of macromolecular association processes.

Validation of a Polarizable MM/MD Potential by Quantum Chemistry; The Journal of Physical Chemistry B 2017, 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b01053.

ABSTRACT: Summary. In the context of the SIBFA polarizable molecular mechanics/dynamics (PMM/PMD) procedure, we report the calibration and a series of validation tests for the 1,2,4-triazole-3-thione (TZT) heterocycle. TZT acts as the chelating group of inhibitors of di-zinc metallo-beta-lactamases (MBL), an emerging class of Zn-dependent bacterial enzymes, which by cleaving the beta-lactam bond of most beta-lactam antibiotics are responsible for the acquired resistance of bacteria to these drugs. Such a study is indispensable prior to performing PMD simulations of complexes of TZT-based inhibitors with MBL’s, on account of the anchoring role of TZT in the dizinc MBL recognition site. Calibration was done by comparisons to Energy Decomposition Analyses (EDA) of high-level ab initio QC computations of the TZT complexes with two probes: Zn(II), representative of ‘soft’ dications, and water, representative of dipolar molecules. We performed distance variations of the approach of each probe to each of the two TZT atoms involved in Zn ligation, the S atom and the N atom ortho to it, so that each SIBFA contribution matches its QC counterpart. Validations were obtained by performing in- and out-of-plane angular variations of Zn(II) binding in monoligated Zn(II)-TZT complexes. The most demanding part of this study was then addressed. How well does DE(SIBFA) and its individual contributions compare to their QC counterparts in the dizinc binding site of one MBL, L1, whose structure is known from high-resolution X-ray crystallography? Six distinct complexes were considered, namely each separate monozinc site, and the dizinc site, whether ligated or unligated by TZT. Despite the large magnitude of the interaction energies, in all six complexes DE(SIBFA) can match DE(QC) with relative errors < 2% and the proper balance of individual energy contributions. Such validations should enable a secure design of a diversity of TZT-containing MBL inhibitors: a structurally and energetically correct anchoring of TZT should enable all other inhibitor groups to in turn optimize their interactions with the other target MBL residues.
","Alimohamadi, H.; Vasan, R.; Hassinger, J. E.; Stachowiak, J.; Rangamani, P. The Role of Traction in Membrane Curvature Generation. bioRxiv 2017.

Curvature in biological membranes can be generated by a variety of different molecular mechanisms such as protein scaffolding, lipid or protein asymmetry, cytoskeletal forces, etc. These mechanisms have the net effect of generating stresses on the bilayer that are translated into distinct final shapes of the membrane. We propose reversing this input-output relationship by using the shape of a curved membrane to infer physical quantities like the magnitude of the applied forces acting on the bilayer. To do this, we calculate the normal and tangential tractions along the membrane using the known material properties of the membrane along with its shape. These tractions are a quantitative measure of the response of the membrane to external forces or sources of spontaneous curvature. We demonstrate the utility of this approach first by showing that the magnitude of applied force can be inferred from the shape of the membrane alone in both simulations and experiments of membrane tubulation. Next, we show that membrane budding by local differences in spontaneous curvature is driven purely by the generation of traction in the radial direction and the emergence of an effective line tension at the boundary of these regions. Finally, we show that performing this calculation on images of phase-separated giant vesicles yields a line tension similar to experimentally determined values."

Coarse-grained representation of the quasi adiabatic propagator path integral for the treatment of non-Markovian long-time bath memory
Richter, Martin  Fingerhut, Benjamin P. The Journal of Chemical Physics 2017 146 21 doi: 10.1063/1.4984075

The description of non-Markovian effects imposed by low frequency bath modes poses a persistent challenge for path integral based approaches like the iterative quasi-adiabatic propagator path integral (iQUAPI) method. We present a novel approximate method, termed mask assisted coarse graining of influence coefficients (MACGIC)-iQUAPI, that offers appealing computational savings due to substantial reduction of considered path segments for propagation. The method relies on an efficient path segment merging procedure via an intermediate coarse grained representation of Feynman-Vernon influence coefficients that exploits physical properties of system decoherence. The MACGIC-iQUAPI method allows us to access the regime of biological significant long-time bath memory on the order of hundred propagation time steps while retaining convergence to iQUAPI results. Numerical performance is demonstrated for a set of benchmark problems that cover bath assisted long range electron transfer, the transition from coherent to incoherent dynamics in a prototypical molecular dimer and excitation energy transfer in a 24-state model of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson trimer complex where in all cases excellent agreement with numerically exact reference data is obtained.","A. Antonioni and A. Cardillo, Coevolution of Synchronization and Cooperation in Costly Networked Interactions, Phys. Rev. Lett., 118, 238301 (2017)

Abstract: Despite the large number of studies on synchronization, the hypothesis that interactions bear a cost for involved individuals has seldom been considered. The introduction of costly interactions leads, instead, to the formulation of a dichotomous scenario in which an individual may decide to cooperate and pay the cost in order to get synchronized with the rest of the population. Alternatively, the same individual can decide to free ride, without incurring any cost, waiting for others to get synchronized to his or her state. Thus, the emergence of synchronization may be seen as the byproduct of an evolutionary game in which individuals decide their behavior according to the benefit-to-cost ratio they accrued in the past. We study the onset of cooperation and synchronization in networked populations of Kuramoto oscillators and report how topology is essential in order for cooperation to thrive. We also display how different classes of topology foster synchronization differently both at microscopic and macroscopic levels.
","Acceleration and suppression of BAR-domain-induced tubulation by addition of small membrane inclusions of isotropic spontaneous curvatures

Authors: H Noguchi

Journal: arXiv:1706.00185v1

Abstract: The membrane tubulation induced by Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) superfamily proteins is investigated by using coarse-grained meshless membrane simulations. The tubulation is enhanced by laterally isotropic membrane inclusions that generate the same sign of spontaneous curvature as the adsorbed BAR proteins. The inclusions are concentrated in the tubules and reduce the bending energy of the tip of the tubules. On the other hand, the inclusions with an opposite curvature suppress the tubulation by percolated-network formation at a high BAR density while they induce a spherical membrane bud at a low BAR density. When equal amounts of the two types of inclusions (with positive and negative curvatures) are added, their effects cancel each other for the first short period but later the tubulation is slowly accelerated. A positive surface tension suppresses the tubulation.","Momin, M.

ABSTRACT: Although the regulation of function of proteins by allosteric interactions has been identified in many subcellular processes, molecular switches are also known to induce long-range conformational changes in proteins. A less well understood molecular switch involving cis-trans isomerization of a peptidyl-prolyl bond could induce a conformational change directly to the backbone that is propagated to other parts of the protein. However, these switches are elusive and hard to identify because they are intrinsic to biomolecules that are inherently dynamic. Here, we explore the conformational dynamics and free energy landscape of the SH2 domain of Interleukin-2-inducible T-Cell or Tyrosine Kinase (ITK) to fully understand the conformational coupling between the distal cis-trans molecular switch and its binding pocket of the phosphotyrosine motif. We use multiple microsecond-long all-atom molecular dynamics simulations in explicit water for over a total of 60 μs. We show that cis-trans isomerization of the Asn286-Pro287 peptidyl-prolyl bond is directly coupled to the dynamics of the binding pocket of the phosphotyrosine motif, in agreement with previous NMR experiments. Unlike the cis state that is localized and less dynamic in a single free energy basin, the trans state samples two distinct conformations of the binding pocket – one that recognizes the phosphotyrosine motif and the other that is somewhat similar to that of the cis state. The results provide an atomic-level description of a less-well understood allosteric regulation by a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans molecular switch that could aid in the understanding of normal and aberrant sub-cellular processes and the identification of these elusive molecular switches in other proteins."," Li, Z.-L.; Ding, H.-M. Molecular Dynamics Simulations Of Membrane Deformation Induced By The Amphiphilic Helices Of Epsin, Sar1p And Arf1. bioRxiv 2017.

The N-terminal amphiphilic helices of proteins Epsin, Sar1p and Arf1 play a critical role in initiating membrane deformation. We present here the study of the interactions of these amphiphilic helices with the lipid membranes by combining the all-atom and coarse-grained simulations. In the all-atom simulations, we find that the amphiphilic helices of Epsin and Sar1p have a shallower insertion depth into the membrane compared to the amphiphilic helix of Arf1, but remarkably, the amphiphilic helices of Epsin and Sar1p induce higher asymmetry in the lipid packing between the two monolayers of the membrane. The insertion depth of amphiphilic helix into the membrane is determined not only by the overall hydrophobicity but also by the specific distribution of polar and non-polar residues along the helix. To directly compare their ability of deforming the membrane, we further apply coarse-grained simulations to investigate the membranes deformation under the insertion of multiple helices. Importantly, it is found that the amphiphilic helices of Epsin and Sar1p generate a larger membrane curvature than that of Arf1, in accord with the experimental results qualitatively. These findings enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanism of the protein-driven membrane remodeling."

The structure and purity of the synthesized ionic liquid and lithium bis(salicylato)borate Li[BScB] salt were characterized using 1H, 13C, 31P and 11B NMR spectroscopy. The Li[BScB] salt was mixed with ionic liquid in the concentration range from 2.5 mol % to 20 mol %. The physicochemical properties of the resulting electrolytes were characterized using thermal analysis (TGA and DSC), electrical impedance spectroscopy, pulsed-field gradient (PFG) NMR and ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. The apparent transfer numbers of the individual ions were calculated from the diffusion coefficients of the cation and anion as determined by PFG NMR spectroscopy. NMR and ATR-FTIR spectroscopic techniques revealed dynamic interactions between the lithium cation and bis(salicylato)borate anion in the electrolytes. The ion-ion interactions were found to increase with increase in concentration of Li[BScB] salt, which resulted in ionic clustering at concentrations higher than 15 mol % of Li salt in the ionic liquid.","Y. Zhang and G. C. Schatz, Conical Nanopores for Efficient Ion Pumping and Desalination, J. Phys. Chem. Lett., Just Accepted, DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpclett.7b01137

Abstract:Previous experimental and theoretical studies have demonstrated that nanofabricated synthetic channels are able to pump ions using oscillating electric fields. We have recently proposed that conical pores with oscillating surface charges are particularly effective for pumping ions due to rectification that arises from their asymmetric structure. In this work, the energy and thermodynamic efficiency associated with salt pumping using the conical pore pump is studied, with emphasis on pumps needed to desalinate sea water. The energy efficiency is found to be as high as 0.60 $\sim$ 0.83~mol/kJ when the radius of the tip side of the conical pore is two Debye lengths and the pump works with a concentration gradient smaller than 1.5. As a result, the energy consumption needed for sea water desalination with 20% salt rejection is 0.32~kJ/L. In addition, the energy consumption can be further reduced to 0.21~kJ/L (20% salt rejection) if the bias voltage is adaptively altered 4 times during the pump cycle while salt concentration is reduced. If the bias voltage is adaptively increased to higher values, salt rejection can be improved to values that are needed to produce fresh water that satisfies standard requirements. Numerical analysis indicates that the energy consumption is 4.9~kJ/L for 98.6\% salt rejection, which is smaller than the practical minimum energy requirement for RO based methods. In addition, the pumping efficiency can be further improved by tuning the pump structure, increasing the surface charge and employing more adaptive bias voltages. The conical pores are also found to more efficiently counteract the concentration gradient compared to cylindrical counterparts.","Title: The entropy of a complex molecule

Authors: Gérôme Faure, Rafael Delgado-Buscalioni and Pep Español

Abstract: Entropy is a central concept in the theory of coarse-graining. Through Einstein’s formula, it provides the equilibrium probability distribution of the coarse-grained variables used to describe the system of interest. We study with molecular dynamics simulations the equilibrium probability distribution of thermal blobs representing at a coarse-grained level star polymer molecules in melt. Thermal blobs are characterized by the positions and momenta of the centers of mass, and internal energies of the molecules. We show that the entropy of the level of description of thermal blobs can be very well approximated as the sum of the thermodynamic entropy of each single molecule considered as isolated thermodynamic systems. The entropy of a single molecule depends on the intrinsic energy, involving only contributions from the atoms that make the molecule and not from the interactions with atoms of other molecules.

Abstract: Using conservation of energy—a fundamental property of closed classical and quantum mechanical systems— we develop an efficient gradient-domain machine learning (GDML) approach to construct accurate molecular force fields using a restricted number of samples from ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) trajectories. The GDML implementation is able to reproduce global potential energy surfaces of intermediate-sized molecules with an accuracy of 0.3 kcal mol−1 for energies and 1 kcal mol−1 Å−1 for atomic forces using only 1000 confor- mational geometries for training. We demonstrate this accuracy for AIMD trajectories of molecules, including benzene, toluene, naphthalene, ethanol, uracil, and aspirin. The challenge of constructing conservative force fields is accomplished in our work by learning in a Hilbert space of vector-valued functions that obey the law of energy conservation. The GDML approach enables quantitative molecular dynamics simulations for mol- ecules at a fraction of cost of explicit AIMD calculations, thereby allowing the construction of efficient force fields with the accuracy and transferability of high-level ab initio methods.

Abstract CRISPR-Cas9 has become a facile genome editing technology, yet the structural and mechanistic features underlying its function are unclear. Here, we perform extensive molecular simulations in an enhanced sampling regime, using a Gaussian-accelerated molecular dynamics (GaMD) methodology, which probes displacements over hundreds of microseconds to milliseconds, to reveal the conformational dynamics of the endonuclease Cas9 during its activation toward catalysis. We disclose the conformational transition of Cas9 from its apo form to the RNA-bound form, suggesting a mechanism for RNA recruitment in which the domain relocations cause the formation of a positively charged cavity for nucleic acid binding. GaMD also reveals the conformation of a catalytically competent Cas9, which is prone for catalysis and whose experimental characterization is still limited. We show that, upon DNA binding, the conformational dynamics of the HNH domain triggers the formation of the active state, explaining how the HNH domain exerts a conformational control domain over DNA cleavage [Sternberg SH et al. (2015) Nature, 527, 110–113]. These results provide atomic-level information on the molecular mechanism of CRISPR-Cas9 that will inspire future experimental investigations aimed at fully clarifying the biophysics of this unique genome editing machinery and at developing new tools for nucleic acid manipulation based on CRISPR-Cas9."
"Title: Enhanced Sampling of Phase Transitions in Coarse Grained Lipid Bilayers

Authors: David N Stelter and Tom Keyes

Abstract: Freezing and melting of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayers are simulated in both the explicit (Wet) and implicit solvent (Dry) coarse-grained MARTINI force fields with enhanced sampling, via the isobaric, molecular dynamics version of the generalized replica exchange method (gREM). Phase transitions are described with the entropic viewpoint, based upon the statistical temperature as a function of enthalpy, TS(H) = 1/(dS(H)/dH), where S is the configurational entropy. Bilayer thickness, area per lipid, and the second-rank order parameter (P2) are calculated vs temperature in the transition range. In a 32 lipid Wet MARTINI system, transitions in the lipid and water subsystems are strongly coupled, giving rise to considerable structure in TS(H) and the need to specify the state of the water when reporting a lipid transition temperature. For gel lipid+liquid water → fluid lipid+liquid water, we find 292.4 K. The small system is influenced by finite-size effects, but it is argued that the entropic approach is well suited to revealing them, which will be particularly relevant for studies of finite nanosystems where there is no thermodynamic limit. In a 390 lipid Dry MARTINI system, two-dimensional analogs of the topographies of coexisting states (`subphases') seen in pure fluids are found. They are not seen in the 32 lipid Wet or Dry system, but the Dry lipids show a new type of state with gel in one leaflet and tilted gel in the other. Dry bilayer transition temperatures are 333.3 K (390 lipids) and 338 K (32 lipids), indicating that the 32 lipid system is not too small for a qualitative study of the transition. Physical arguments are given for Dry lipid system size-dependence, and for the difference between Wet and Dry systems.

ABSTRACT: A quantitative characterization of the binding properties of drug fragments to a target protein is an important component of a fragment-based drug discovery program. Fragments typically have a weak binding affinity, however, making it challenging to experimentally characterize key binding properties including binding sites, poses, and affinities. Direct simulation of the binding equilibrium by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can provide a computational route to characterize fragment binding, but this approach is so computationally intensive that it has thus far remained relatively unexplored. Here, we perform MD simulations of sufficient length to observe several different fragments spontaneously and repeatedly bind to, and unbind from, the protein FKBP, allowing the binding affinities, the on- and off-rates, and the relative occupancies of alternative binding sites and alternative poses within each binding site to be estimated, thereby illustrating the potential of long-timescale MD as a quantitative tool for fragment-based drug discovery. The data from the long-timescale fragment binding simulations reported here also provides a useful benchmark for testing alternative computational methods aimed at characterizing fragment binding properties. As an example, we calculated binding affinities for the same fragments using a standard free energy perturbation (FEP) approach and found that the values agreed with those obtained from the fragment binding simulations within statistical error.","Title: On the Origin of Non-Arrhenius Behavior of the Rates of Enzymatic Reactions

Authors: Subhendu Roy, Patrick Schopf, and Arieh Warshel

Abstract: The origin of the non-Arrhenius behavior of the rate constant for hydride transfer enzymatic reactions has been a puzzling problem since its initial observation. This effect has been used originally to support the idea that enzymes work by dynamical effects and more recently to suggest an entropy funnel model. Our analysis, however, has advanced the idea that the reason for the non-Arrhenius trend reflects the temperature dependence of the rearrangements of the protein polar groups in response the change in the charge distribution of the reacting system, during the transition from the ground state (GS) to the transition state (TS). Here we examine the validity of our early proposal by simulating the catalytic reaction of Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and determine the microscopic origin of the entropic and enthalpic contributions to the activation barrier. The corresponding analysis establishes the origin of the non-Arrhenius behaviors and quantifies our original suggestion that the classical effect is due to the entropic contributions of the environment. We also find that the quantum effects reflect in part the temperature dependence of the donor acceptor distance.

Abstract: We introduce a powerful iterative algorithm to compute protein folding pathways, with realistic all-atom force fields. Using the path integral formalism, we explicitly derive a modified Langevin equation which samples directly the ensemble of reactive pathways, exponentially reducing the cost of simulating thermally activated transitions.

After illustrating this approach on a simple toy model, we successfully validate it against the results of ultra-long plain MD protein folding simulations for a fast folding protein (Fip35), which were performed on the Anton supercomputer. Using our algorithm, computing a folding trajectory for this protein requires only ∼ 103 core hours, a computational load which could be even carried out on a desktop workstation.

Abstract: p38α is a Ser/Thr protein kinase involved in a variety of cellular processes and pathological conditions, which makes it a promising pharmacological target. Although the activity of the enzyme is highly regulated, its molecular mechanism of activation remains largely unexplained, even after decades of research. By using state-of-the-art molecular dynamics simulations, we decipher the key elements of the complex molecular mechanism refined by evolution to allow for a fine tuning of p38α kinase activity. Our study describes for the first time the molecular effects of different regulators of the enzymatic activity, and provides an integrative picture of the activation mechanism that explains the seemingly contradictory X-ray and NMR data.

ABSTRACT: One of the major challenges in computational science is to determine the uncertainty of a virtual measurement, that is the prediction of an observable based on calculations. As highly accurate first-principles calculations are in general unfeasible for most physical systems, one usually resorts to parameteric property models of observables, which require calibration by incorporating reference data. The resulting predictions and their uncertainties are sensitive to systematic errors such as inconsistent reference data, parametric model assumptions, or inadequate computational methods. Here, we discuss the calibration of property models in the light of bootstrapping, a sampling method akin to Bayesian inference that can be employed for identifying systematic errors and for reliable estimation of the prediction uncertainty. We apply bootstrapping to assess a linear property model linking the 57Fe Mossbauer isomer shift to the contact electron density at the iron nucleus for a diverse set of 44 molecular iron compounds. The contact electron density is calculated with twelve density functionals across Jacob's ladder (PWLDA, BP86, BLYP, PW91, PBE, M06-L, TPSS, B3LYP, B3PW91, PBE0, M06, TPSSh). We provide systematic-error diagnostics and reliable, locally resolved uncertainties for isomer-shift predictions. Pure and hybrid density functionals yield average prediction uncertainties of 0.06-0.08 mm/s-1 and 0.04-0.05 mm/s, respectively, the latter being close to the average experimental uncertainty of 0.02 mm/s. Furthermore, we show that both model parameters and prediction uncertainty depend significantly on the composition and number of reference data points. Accordingly, we suggest that rankings of density functionals based on performance measures (e.g., the coefficient of correlation, r^2, or the root-mean-square error, RMSE) should not be inferred from a single data set. This study presents the first statistically rigorous calibration analysis for theoretical Mossbauer spectroscopy, which is of general applicability for physico-chemical property models and not restricted to isomer-shift predictions. We provide the statistically meaningful reference data set MIS39 and a new calibration of the isomer shift based on the PBE0 functional.

 
","Title: 'Martinizing' the Variational Implicit Solvent Method (VISM): Solvation Free Energy for Coarse-Grained Proteins

Authors: Clarisse Gravina Ricci, Bo Li, Li-Tien Cheng, Joachim Dzubiella, and J. Andrew McCammon

Abstract: Solvation is a fundamental driving force in many biological processes including biomolecular recognition and self-assembly, not to mention protein folding, dynamics, and function. The Variational Implicit Solvent Method (VISM) is a theoretical tool currently developed and optimized to estimate solvation free energies for systems of very complex topology, such as biomolecules. VISM’s theoretical framework makes it unique because it couples hydrophobic, van der Waals and electrostatic interactions as a functional of the solvation interface. By minimizing this functional, VISM produces the solvation interface as an output of the theory. In this work, we push VISM to larger scale applications by combining it with coarse-grained solute Hamiltonians adapted from the MARTINI framework, a well-established meso-scale force field for modeling large-scale biomolecule assemblies. We show how MARTINI-VISM (MVISM) compares with atomistic VISM (AVISM) for a small set of proteins differing in size, shape and charge distribution. We also demonstrate MVISM’s suitability to study the solvation properties of an interesting encounter complex, barnase-barstar. The promising results suggest that coarse-graining the protein with the MARTINI force field is indeed a valuable step to broaden VISM’s and MARTINI’s applications in the near future.

Abstract: An adaptive procedure is introduced to construct smooth analytical profiles of the free energy along a reaction coordinate using sampled data from multiple biased simulations. The procedure is based upon identifying problematic regions encountered in maximum likelihood estimators of the profile where there are statistically relevant discrepancies between the empirical and parameterized cumulative distribution functions and preferentially improving the construction of the parametric profile in these regions. The method is designed to produce continuous and smooth analytical fits that satisfy statistical goodness-of-fit tests with a minimum number of parameters. The accuracy of the profile obtained from the adaptive construction is compared by numerical computation to that of smooth interpolations based on an optimally-chosen weighted histogram method for a solvated ion pair system and for an activated process for which the analytical form of the potential of mean force is available. In the model where the exact profile is known, the adaptive procedure is shown to reduce the integrated error relative to the optimal histogram construction by a factor of three or more in the typical case where the sampling is not extensive. It is demonstrated that the adaptive procedure can be used to produce statistically accurate smooth analytical representations of the free energy profile that can be evaluated with little computational effort and require little user input.","Coherent State Mapping Ring-Polymer Molecular Dynamics for Non-Adiabatic quantum propagations

DOI: arXiv:1706.08403

Abstract We introduce the coherent state mapping ring-polymer molecular dynamics (CS-RPMD), a new method that accurately describes electronic non-adiabatic dynamics with explicit nuclear quantization. This new approach is derived by using coherent state mapping representation for the electronic degrees of freedom (DOF) and the ring-polymer path-integral representation for the nuclear DOF. CS-RPMD Hamiltonian does not contain any inter-bead coupling term in the state-dependent potential, which is a key feature that ensures correct electronic Rabi oscillations. Hamilton's equation of motion is used to sample initial configurations and propagate the trajectories, preserving the distribution with classical symplectic evolution. In the special one-bead limit for mapping variables, CS-RPMD preserves the detailed balance. Numerical tests of this method with a two-state model system show a very good agreement with exact quantum results over a broad range of electronic couplings. "
"Title: Release of Cytochrome C from Bax Pores at the Mitochondrial Membrane

Authors: Mingzhen Zhang, Jie Zheng, Ruth Nussinov and Buyong Ma

Abstract: How cytochrome C is released from the mitochondria to the cytosol via Bax oligomeric pores, a process which is required for apoptosis, is still a mystery. Based on experimentally measured residue-residue distances, we recently solved the first atomic model for Bax oligomeric pores at the membranes using computational approaches. Here, we investigate the mechanism at the microsecond time- and nanometer space- scale using MD simulations. Our free energy landscape depicts a low barrier for the permeation of cytochrome C into the Bax C-terminal mouth, with the pathway proceeding to the inner cavity and exiting via the N-terminal mouth. Release is guided by organized charged/hydrophilic surfaces. The hydrophilicity and negative charge of the pore surface gradually increase along the release pathway from the pore entry to the exit opening. Rather than inert passing of the cytochrome C through a rigid pore, the flexible pore may selectively aid the cytochrome C passage. Once the Bax pore is formed in the membrane, with a low energy barrier, the release of cytochrome C may be readily achieved through energy fluctuations. Collectively, our work provides mechanistic insight in atomic detail into the release of cytochrome C through Bax oligomeric pores.

ABSTRACT: Threonyl-tRNA synthetase (ThrRS) is a Zn(II) containing enzyme that catalyzes the activation of threonine and its subsequent transfer to the cognate tRNA. This process is accomplished with remarkable fidelity, with ThrRS being able to discriminate its cognate substrate from similar analogs such as serine and valine. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and hybrid Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics (QM/MM) methods have been used to elucidate the role of Zn(II) in the aminoacylation mechanism of ThrRS. More specifically, the role of Zn(II) and active site residues in ThrRS's ability to discriminate between its cognate substrate L-threonine, and the non-cognate L-serine, L-valine and D-threonine has been examined. The present results suggest that a role of the Zn(II) ion, with its Lewis acidity, is to facilitate deprotonation of the side chain hydroxyl groups of the aminoacyl moieties of cognate Thr-AMP and non-cognate Ser- AMP substrates. In their deprotonated forms these substrates are able to adopt a conformation preferable for aminoacyl transfer from aa-AMP onto the Ado-3'OH of the tRNAThr cosubstrate. Relative to the neutral substrates, when the substrates are first deprotonated with the assistance of the Zn(II) ion the barrier for the rate-limiting step is decreased significantly by 42.0 and 39.2 kJ mol-1 for L-Thr-AMP and L-Ser-AMP, respectively. An active site arginyl also plays a key role in stabilizing the build-up of negative charge on the substrate's bridging phosphate oxygen during the mechanism. For the enantiomeric substrate analog D-Thr-AMP, product formation is highly disfavoured and as a result, the reverse reaction has a very low barrier of 16.0 kJ mol-1.

The influence of the membrane on transmembrane proteins is central to a number of biological phenomena, notably the gating of stretch activated ion channels. Conversely, membrane proteins can influence the bilayer, leading to the stabilization of particular membrane shapes, topological changes that occur during vesicle fission and fusion, and shape-dependent protein aggregation. Continuum elastic models of the membrane have been widely used to study protein-membrane interactions. These mathematical approaches produce physically interpretable membrane shapes, energy estimates for the cost of deformation, and a snapshot of the equilibrium configuration. Moreover, elastic models are much less computationally demanding than fully atomistic and coarse-grained simulation methodologies; however, it has been argued that continuum models cannot reproduce the distortions observed in fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. We suggest that this failure can be overcome by using chemically and geometrically accurate representations of the protein. Here, we present a fast and reliable hybrid continuum-atomistic model that couples the protein to the membrane. We show that the model is in excellent agreement with fully atomistic simulations of the ion channel gramicidin embedded in a POPC membrane. Our continuum calculations not only reproduce the membrane distortions produced by the channel but also accurately determine the channel?s orientation. Finally, we use our method to investigate the role of membrane bending around the charged voltage sensors of the transient receptor potential cation channel TRPV1. We find that membrane deformation significantly stabilizes the energy of insertion of TRPV1 by exposing charged residues on the S4 segment to solution.","B Kowalik, A Schlaich, M Kanduč, E Schneck, and RR Netz, ""Hydration Repulsion Difference between Ordered and Disordered Membranes Due to Cancellation of Membrane–Membrane and Water-Mediated Interactions"" J. Phys. Chem. Lett.  8 (2017): 2869.

Hydration repulsion acts between all sufficiently polar surfaces in water at small separations and prevents dry adhesion up to kilobar pressures. Yet it remained unclear whether this ubiquitous force depends on surface structure or is a sole water property. We demonstrate that previous deviations among different experimental measurements of hydration pressures in phospholipid bilayer stacks disappear when plotting data consistently as a function of repeat distance or membrane surface distance. The resulting pressure versus distance curves agree quantitatively with our atomistic simulation results and exhibit different decay lengths in the ordered gel and the disordered fluid states. This suggests that hydration forces are not caused by water ordering effects alone. Splitting the simulated total pressure into membrane–membrane and water-mediated parts shows that these contributions are opposite in sign and of similar magnitude, thus they are equally important. The resulting net hydration pressure between membranes is what remains from the near-cancellation of these ambivalent contributions.

Abstract Typical experimental setups for molecular systems must deal with a certain coupling to the external environment, that is, the system is open and exchanges mass, momentum, and energy with its surroundings. Instead, standard molecular simulations are mostly performed using periodic boundary conditions with a constant number of molecules. In this review, we summarize major developments of open simulation methodologies, which, contrary to standard techniques, open up the boundaries of a molecular system and allow for exchange of energy and matter with the environment, in and out of equilibrium. In particular, we construct the review around the open simulation approaches based on the Adaptive Resolution Scheme (AdResS), which seamlessly couples different levels of resolution in molecular simulations. Ideas and theoretical concepts used in its development lie at the crossroad of different fields and disciplines and open many different directions for future developments in molecular simulation. We examine progress related to theoretical as well as novel modeling approaches bridging length scales from quantum to the continuum description and report on their application in various molecular systems. The outlook of the review is dedicated to the perspective of how to further incorporate rigorous theoretical approaches such as the Bergman-Lebowitz and Emch-Sewell models into the molecular simulation algorithms and stimulate further development of open simulation methods and their application.

Amphotericin B (AmB) is still the most effective drug for the treatment of systemic fungal infections in humans. Despite significant theoretical and experimental efforts trying to understand its molecular mechanism of action, the answer has remained elusive. In this work, we present a computational methodology to test the current membrane related hypotheses, namely, transmembrane ion channel, adsorption, and sterol sponge. We use a thermodynamic approach in which we represent the membrane by a multi-phase solvation model with atomic detail (MMPSM), and calculate the free energy of transferring the drug between phases with different dielectric properties. Furthermore, we compare AmB to a chemical analog with increased safety, an L-histidine methyl ester of AmB. Our findings reveal that both drugs dimerize in all solvents studied here. Also, it is energetically unfavorable for the drugs to penetrate into the hydrophobic core of the membrane, unless their concentration is high. Finally, it is thermodynamically possible that the sterols migrate from the membrane into a drug droplet adsorbed at the surface of the bilayer. In light of our results, several effects could take place in the complex antibiotic process. We suggest a molecular mechanism that connects all three hypotheses through a drug concentration dependence and propose that the drug promotes the formation of membrane toroidal pores.

Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) involves nanoscale bending and inward budding of the plasma membrane, by which cells regulate both the distribution of membrane proteins and the entry of extracellular species1, 2. Extensive studies have shown that CME proteins actively modulate the plasma membrane curvature1, 3, 4. However, the reciprocal regulation of how the plasma membrane curvature affects the activities of endocytic proteins is much less explored, despite studies suggesting that membrane curvature itself can trigger biochemical reactions5, 6, 7, 8. This gap in our understanding is largely due to technical challenges in precisely controlling the membrane curvature in live cells. In this work, we use patterned nanostructures to generate well-defined membrane curvatures ranging from +50 nm to −500 nm radius of curvature. We find that the positively curved membranes are CME hotspots, and that key CME proteins, clathrin and dynamin, show a strong preference towards positive membrane curvatures with a radius <200 nm. Of ten CME-related proteins we examined, all show preferences for positively curved membrane. In contrast, other membrane-associated proteins and non-CME endocytic protein caveolin1 show no such curvature preference. Therefore, nanostructured substrates constitute a novel tool for investigating curvature-dependent processes in live cells.

The N-terminal amphiphilic helices of proteins Epsin, Sar1p and Arf1 play a critical role in initiating membrane deformation. We present here the study of the interactions of these amphiphilic helices with the lipid membranes by combining the all-atom and coarse-grained simulations. In the all-atom simulations, we find that the amphiphilic helices of Epsin and Sar1p have a shallower insertion depth into the membrane compared to the amphiphilic helix of Arf1, but remarkably, the amphiphilic helices of Epsin and Sar1p induce higher asymmetry in the lipid packing between the two monolayers of the membrane. The insertion depth of amphiphilic helix into the membrane is determined not only by the overall hydrophobicity but also by the specific distribution of polar and non-polar residues along the helix. To directly compare their ability of deforming the membrane, we further apply coarse-grained simulations to investigate the membranes deformation under the insertion of multiple helices. Importantly, it is found that the amphiphilic helices of Epsin and Sar1p generate a larger membrane curvature than that of Arf1, in accord with the experimental results qualitatively. These findings enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanism of the protein-driven membrane remodeling.

Molecular recognition by proteins is fundamental to molecular biology. Dissection of the thermodynamic energy terms governing protein–ligand interactions has proven difficult, with determination of entropic contributions being particularly elusive. NMR relaxation measurements have suggested that changes in protein conformational entropy can be quantitatively obtained through a dynamical proxy, but the generality of this relationship has not been shown. Twenty-eight protein–ligand complexes are used to show a quantitative relationship between measures of fast side-chain motion and the underlying conformational entropy. We find that the contribution of conformational entropy can range from favorable to unfavorable, which demonstrates the potential of this thermodynamic variable to modulate protein–ligand interactions. For about one-quarter of these complexes, the absence of conformational entropy would render the resulting affinity biologically meaningless. The dynamical proxy for conformational entropy or “entropy meter” also allows for refinement of the contributions of solvent entropy and the loss in rotational-translational entropy accompanying formation of high-affinity complexes. Furthermore, structure-based application of the approach can also provide insight into long-lived specific water–protein interactions that escape the generic treatments of solvent entropy based simply on changes in accessible surface area. These results provide a comprehensive and unified view of the general role of entropy in high-affinity molecular recognition by proteins.

Abstract This paper presents a new model for polymersomes developed using a poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(butadiene) diblock copolymer bilayer. The model is based on a coarse-grained approach using the MARTINI force field. Since no MARTINI parameters exist for poly(butadiene), we have refined these parameters using quantum mechanical calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. The model has been validated using extensive molecular dynamics simulations in systems with several hundred polymer units and reaching up to 6 μμs. These simulations show that the copolymer coarse grain model self-assemble into bilayers and that NPT and NPNγT ensemble runs reproduce key structural and mechanical experimental properties for different copolymer length chains with a similar hydrophilic weight fraction.

Membrane proteins constitute a large portion of the human proteome and perform a variety of important functions as membrane receptors, transport proteins, enzymes, signaling proteins, and more. Computational studies of membrane proteins are usually much more complicated than those of globular proteins. Here we propose a new continuum model for Poisson-Boltzmann calculations of membrane channel proteins. Major improvements over the existing continuum slab model are as follows: 1) The location and thickness of the slab model are fine-tuned based on explicit-solvent MD simulations. 2) The highly different accessibility in the membrane and water regions are addressed with a two-step, two-probe grid labeling procedure, and 3) The water pores/channels are automatically identified. The new continuum membrane model is optimized (by adjusting the membrane probe, as well as the slab thickness and center) to best reproduce the distributions of buried water molecules in the membrane region as sampled in explicit water simulations. Our optimization also shows that the widely adopted water probe of 1.4 Å for globular proteins is a very reasonable default value for membrane protein simulations. It gives an overall minimum number of inconsistencies between the continuum and explicit representations of water distributions in membrane channel proteins, at least in the water accessible pore/channel regions that we focus on. Finally, we validate the new membrane model by carrying out binding affinity calculations for a potassium channel, and we observe a good agreement with experiment results.","Enhanced Sampling of Phase Transitions in Coarse-Grained Lipid Bilayers

Freezing and melting of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayers are simulated in both the explicit (Wet) and implicit solvent (Dry) coarse-grained MARTINI force fields with enhanced sampling, via the isobaric, molecular dynamics version of the generalized replica exchange method (gREM). Phase transitions are described with the entropic viewpoint, based upon the statistical temperature as a function of enthalpy, TS(H) = 1/(dS(H)/dH), where S is the configurational entropy. Bilayer thickness, area per lipid, and the second-rank order parameter (P2) are calculated vs temperature in the transition range. In a 32-lipid Wet MARTINI system, transitions in the lipid and water subsystems are strongly coupled, giving rise to considerable structure in TS(H) and the need to specify the state of the water when reporting a lipid transition temperature. For gel lipid + liquid water → fluid lipid + liquid water, we find 292.4 K. The small system is influenced by finite-size effects, but it is argued that the entropic approach is well suited to revealing them, which will be particularly relevant for studies of finite nanosystems where there is no thermodynamic limit. In a 390-lipid Dry MARTINI system, two-dimensional analogues of the topographies of coexisting states (“subphases”) seen in pure fluids are found. They are not seen in the 32-lipid Wet or Dry system, but the Dry lipids show a new type of state with gel in one leaflet and tilted gel in the other. Dry bilayer transition temperatures are 333.3 K (390 lipids) and 338 K (32 lipids), indicating that the 32-lipid system is not too small for a qualitative study of the transition. Physical arguments are given for Dry lipid system size dependence and for the difference between Wet and Dry systems.

Electronic circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy of peptides is one of the most important experimental characterization tools to get insights regarding their structure. Nevertheless, even though highly useful, the reliable simulations of CD spectra result in a complex task. Here, we propose a combination of quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods with a semiempirical Hamiltonian based on the Frenkel excitons theory to efficiently describe the behavior of a model 27-amino acid α-helical peptide in water. Especially, we show how the choice of the QM region, including different possible hydrogen-bonding patterns, can substantially change the final CD spectrum shape. Moreover, we prove that our approach can correctly explain the changes observed in the peptide conformation (from α-helix to α-hairpin) when covalently linked to a protonated retinal-like molecular switch and exposing the system to UVA light, as previously observed by experiment and extensive molecular dynamics. Hence our protocol may be straightforwardly exploited to characterize light-induced conformation changes in photoactive materials and more generally protein folding processes.

Abstract We consider a coarse-grained (CG) model with pairwise interactions, suitable to describe low-density solutions of star-branched polymers of functionality f. Each macromolecule is represented by a CG molecule with (f + 1) interaction sites, which captures the star topology. Potentials are obtained by requiring the CG model to reproduce a set of distribution functions computed in the microscopic model in the zero-density limit. Explicit results are given for f = 6, 12, and 40. We use the CG model to compute the osmotic equation of state of the solution for concentrations c such that Φp = c/c ∗ . 1, where c ∗ is the overlap concentration. We also investigate in detail the phase diagram for f = 40, identifying the boundaries of the solid intermediate phase. Finally, we investigate how the polymer size changes with c. For Φp . 0.3, polymers become harder as f increases at fixed reduced concentration c/c ∗ . On the other hand, for Φp & 0.3, polymers show the opposite behavior: At fixed Φp, the larger the value of f, the larger their size reduction is.

An overwhelming amount of experimental evidence suggests that elucidations of protein function, interactions, and pathology are incomplete without inclusion of intrinsic protein disorder and structural dynamics. Thus, to expand our understanding of intrinsic protein disorder, we have created a database of secondary structure (SS) propensities for proteins (dSPP) as a reference resource for experimental research and computational biophysics. The dSPP comprises SS propensities of 7,094 unrelated proteins, as gauged from NMR chemical shift measurements in solution and solid state. Here, we explain the concept of SS propensity and analyze dSPP entries of therapeutic relevance, α-synuclein, MOAG-4, and the ZIKA NS2B-NS3 complex to show: (1) how propensity mapping generates novel structural insights into intrinsically disordered regions of pathologically relevant proteins, (2) how computational biophysics tools can benefit from propensity mapping, and (3) how the residual disorder estimation based on NMR chemical shifts compares with sequence-based disorder predictors. This work demonstrates the benefit of propensity estimation as a method that reports both on protein structure, lability, and disorder.","Solute Partitioning in Micelles: Combining Molecular Dynamics Simulations, COSMOmic, and Experiments

The partition equilibria of solutes between micelles and an aqueous phase is a key factor in many applications. Depending on the task, many micelle–solute combinations are possible. Therefore, theoretical methods to predict the partition behavior in micellar systems are needed. Here, two predictive methods are evaluated and compared. First, it is shown how molecular dynamics simulations (MD) with the umbrella sampling method can be used to calculate free energy profiles in micellar systems. The second applied method is an extension of the COSMO-RS theory to anisotropic systems termed COSMOmic. Both methods are compared by means of free energy profiles and experimental micelle/water partition coefficients. A particular focus is on the partitioning of ionized solutes. As experimental data for partitioning in micelles especially for charged solutes is rare, partition coefficients were also determined experimentally. To get a general understanding of micelles examples of all micelle classes (classified by headgroup charge) are studied: nonionic Triton X-114 (TX114), zwitterionic miltefosine (HePC), anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and cationic cetyltrimethylammonium bromid (CTAB). The free energy profiles of neutral solutes obtained from MD simulations and COSMOmic are in an overall good agreement, and partition coefficients from both methods are in good agreement with experimental data. Depending on the system, the results for charged solutes show some deviations between the methods and experimental data.","Morishita, T.; Yonezawa, Y.; Ito, A. M. Free Energy Reconstruction from Logarithmic Mean-Force Dynamics Using Multiple Nonequilibrium Trajectories. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2017. ASAP

Efficient and reliable estimation of the mean-force (MF), the derivatives of the free-energy with respect to a set of collective variables (CVs), has been a challenging problem, since free-energy differences are often computed by integrating the MF. Among various methods for computing free-energy differences, logarithmic mean-force dynamics (LogMFD) [T. Morishita et al., Phys. Rev. E 2012, 85, 066702] invokes the conservation law in classical mechanics to integrate the MF, which allows us to estimate the free-energy profile along the CVs on-the-fly. Here, we present a method called parallel-dynamics, which improves the estimation of the MF by employing multiple replicas of the system and is straightforwardly incorporated in LogMFD or a related method. In the parallel-dynamics, the MF is evaluated by a nonequilibrium path-ensemble using the multiple replicas based on the Crooks-Jarzynski nonequilibrium work relation. Thanks to the Crooks relation, realizing full-equilibrium states is no longer mandatory for estimating the MF. Additionally, sampling in the hidden subspace orthogonal to the CV-space is highly improved with appropriate weights for each metastable state (if any), which is hardly achievable by typical free-energy computational methods. We illustrate how to implement parallel-dynamics, by combining it with LogMFD, which we call logarithmic parallel-dynamics (LogPD). Biosystems of alanine dipeptide and adenylate kinase in explicit water are employed as benchmark systems, to which LogPD is applied to demonstrate the effect of multiple replicas on the accuracy and efficiency in estimating the free-energy profiles using parallel-dynamics.","MY Shelley, ME Selvan, J Zhao, V Babin, C Liao, J Li, and JC Shelley, ""A new mixed all-atom/coarse-grained model: application to melittin aggregation in aqueous solution"" J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2017 ASAP Article.

We introduce a new mixed resolution, all-atom/coarse-grained approach (AACG) for modeling peptides in aqueous solution and apply it to characterizing the aggregation of melittin. All of the atoms in peptidic components are represented while a single site is used for each water molecule. With the full flexibility of the peptide retained, our AACG method achieves speedups by a factor of 3-4 for CPU time reduction and another factor of roughly 7 for diffusion. An Ewald treatment permits the inclusion of long-range electrostatic interactions. These characteristics fit well with the requirements for studying peptide association and aggregation, where the system sizes and time scales require considerable computational resources with all-atom models. In particular, AACG is well suited for biologics since changes in peptide shape and long-range electrostatics may play an important role. The application of AACG to melittin, a 26-residue peptide with a well-known propensity to aggregate in solution, serves as an initial demonstration of this technology for studying peptide aggregation. We observed the formation of melittin aggregates during our simulations, and characterized the time-evolution of aggregate size distribution, buried surface areas and residue contacts. Key interactions including π-cation and π stacking involving TRP19 were also examined. Our AACG simulations demonstrated a clear salt effect and a moderate temperature effect on aggregation and support the molten globule model of melittin aggregates. As a showcase, this work illustrates the useful role for AACG in investigations of peptide aggregation and its potential to guide formulation and design of biologics.","Coalescence of nanoclusters analyzed by Well-Tempered Metadynamics.

This methodology shows to be useful to understand the present phenomenon in terms of two collective variables: the distance between the center of mass of the coalescing particles and the gyration radius of the resulting core element. The free-energy contour plots clearly show that the coalescence process involves the deformation of the core material, which is manifested in the residence of the system in regions with a larger gyration radius. Results from molecular dynamics for the same system were found helpful to reach the definition of this second collective variable. The advantages and limitations of the latter approach are discussed."

Abstract Hydronium (H3O+) and hydroxide (OH-) ions have anomalously large diffusion constants in aqueous solutions due to their combination of vehicular and Grotthuss hopping diffusion mechanisms. An improvement of ReaxFF reactive water force field on the basis of our previous first-generation ReaxFF water force field (water-2010) is presented to describe the proton transfer (PT) mechanisms of H3O+ and OH- in water. Molecular dynamics simulation studies with water-2017 force field support the Eigen-Zundel-Eigen mechanism for PT in acidic aqueous solution and reproduce the hyper-coordinated solvation structure of the OH- in basic environment. In particular, it predicts the correct order of the diffusion constants of H2O, H3O+ and OH- and their values are in agreement with the experimental data. Another interesting observation is that the diffusion constants of H3O+ and OH- are close to each other at the high concentration due to the strong correlation between OH- ions in basic aqueous solution. Based on our results, it is shown that ReaxFF provides a novel approach to study the complex acid-base chemical reactions in aqueous solution with any pH value.

Psi4 is an ab initio electronic structure program providing methods such as Hartree–Fock, density functional theory, configuration interaction, and coupled-cluster theory. The 1.1 release represents a major update meant to automate complex tasks, such as geometry optimization using complete-basis-set extrapolation or focal-point methods. Conversion of the top-level code to a Python module means that Psi4 can now be used in complex workflows alongside other Python tools. Several new features have been added with the aid of libraries providing easy access to techniques such as density fitting, Cholesky decomposition, and Laplace denominators. The build system has been completely rewritten to simplify interoperability with independent, reusable software components for quantum chemistry. Finally, a wide range of new theoretical methods and analyses have been added to the code base, including functional-group and open-shell symmetry adapted perturbation theory, density-fitted coupled cluster with frozen natural orbitals, orbital-optimized perturbation and coupled-cluster methods (e.g., OO-MP2 and OO-LCCD), density-fitted multiconfigurational self-consistent field, density cumulant functional theory, algebraic-diagrammatic construction excited states, improvements to the geometry optimizer, and the “X2C” approach to relativistic corrections, among many other improvements.","Complete protein–protein association kinetics in atomic detail revealed by molecular dynamics simulations and Markov modelling

Abstract Protein–protein association is fundamental to many life processes. However, a microscopic model describing the structures and kinetics during association and dissociation is lacking on account of the long lifetimes of associated states, which have prevented efficient sampling by direct molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Here we demonstrate protein–protein association and dissociation in atomistic resolution for the ribonuclease barnase and its inhibitor barstar by combining adaptive high-throughput MD simulations and hidden Markov modelling. The model reveals experimentally consistent intermediate structures, energetics and kinetics on timescales from microseconds to hours. A variety of flexibly attached intermediates and misbound states funnel down to a transition state and a native basin consisting of the loosely bound near-native state and the tightly bound crystallographic state. These results offer a deeper level of insight into macromolecular recognition and our approach opens the door for understanding and manipulating a wide range of macromolecular association processes.

The structure of the hydrogen bond network inside of the proton conductive channel is of significant importance to proton transfer confined in a nanochannel. In order to investigate the independent effects of fluorination and confinement dimension on the hydrogen bond network, a one-dimensional carbon nanotube decorated with fluorine was built to mimic the environment of the proton conductive channel in the perfluorosulfonic membrane ( Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys.2016, 18 (35), 24198−24209). It was found that a fluorinated nanochannel helps to form a spiral-like sequential hydrogen bond network with few branched hydrogen bonds in the central region, which is believed to promote unidirectional proton transfer along the channel axis without random movement. To explore the mechanism of the formation of the spiral-like hydrogen bond structure, molecular dynamics simulation was conducted to analyze the hydrogen bonding properties of water and a hydrated proton confined in the fluorinated CNT with chirality of (10,10). The hydrogen bond criteria were initially evaluated for the water–water and hydronium–water hydrogen bonds. It was found that the confined hydrated protons help maintain the connectivity of the hydrogen bond network along the axis of the fluorinated nanochannel at different temperatures. The hydronium ion prefers to form hydrogen bonds with two neighboring water molecules, resulting in a continuous hydrogen bond network. The non-hydrogen-bonded hydrogen atom of the hydronium ion has strong attraction with the fluorinated channel surface, stabilizing the hydrogen bond structure and making space in the central region of the nanochannel. The connectivity of the hydrogen bond network and the interaction between hydronium and the channel surface produce the spiral-like structure of the hydrogen bond network along the axis of the fluorinated nanochannel with few branched hydrogen bonds.

Abstract. Computational and structural studies have been indispensable in investigating the molecular origins of actin filament mechanical properties and modulation by the regulatory severing protein cofilin. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations of cofilactin filament structures determined by electron cryomicroscopy reveal how cofilin enhances the bending and twisting compliance of actin filaments. Continuum mechanics models suggest that buckled cofilactin filaments localize elastic energy at boundaries between bare and cofilin-decorated segments because of their nonuniform elasticity, thereby accelerating filament severing. Here, we develop mesoscopic length-scale (cofil)actin filament models and evaluate the effects of compressive and twisting loads on strain energy distribution at specific interprotein interfaces. The models reliably capture the filament bending and torsional rigidities and intersubunit torsional flexibility measured experimentally with purified protein components. Buckling is predicted to enhance cofilactin filament severing with minimal effects on cofilin occupancy, whereas filament twisting enhances cofilin dissociation without compromising filament integrity. Preferential severing at actin-cofilactin boundaries of buckled filaments is more prominent than predicted by continuum models because of the enhanced spatial resolution. The models developed here will be valuable for evaluating the effects of filament shape deformations on filament stability and interactions with regulatory proteins, and analysis of single filament manipulation assays.

Abstract The behavior of aqueous solutions of sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl)sulfosuccinate (AOTNa) under conditions of electrospray ionization (ESI) has been investigated by molecular dynamics (MD) and well-tempered metadynamics (WTM) simulations at 300 K and 400 K. We have examined water droplets with initial fixed numbers of water molecules (1000) and AOT− anions (100), and with sodium cations in the range of 70–130. At 300 K, all charged droplets show the water evaporation rate increasing with the absolute value of the initial droplet charge state (Z), accompanied by ejection of an increasing number of solvated sodium ions or by expulsion of AOT− anions depending on the sign of Z and by fragmentation in the case of high |Z|. At 400 K, the water evaporation becomes more rapid and the fission process more extensive. In all cases, the AOTNa molecules, arranged as a direct micelle inside the aqueous system, undergo a rapid inversion in vacuo so that the hydrophilic heads and sodium ions surrounded by water molecules move toward the droplet interior. At the end of the 100-ns MD simulations, some water molecules remain within the aggregates at both temperatures. The subsequent metadynamics simulations accelerate the droplet evolution and show that all systems become anhydrous, in agreement with the experimental results of ESI mass spectrometry. This complete water loss is accompanied by sodium counterion emission for positively charged aggregates at 300 K. The analysis shows how the temperature and droplet charge state affect the populations of the generated surfactant aggregates, providing information potentially useful in designing future ESI experimental conditions.","Structural Basis for Asymmetric Conductance of the Influenza M2 Proton Channel Investigated by Solid-State NMR Spectroscopy. 
Venkata S. Mandala, Shu-Yu Liao, Byungsu Kwon, Mei Hong, Journal of Molecular Biology, Available online 20 May 2017, ISSN 0022-2836, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2017.05.015.

The influenza M2 protein forms an acid-activated proton channel that is essential for virus replication. The transmembrane H37 selects for protons under low external pH while W41 ensures proton conduction only from the N terminus to the C terminus and prevents reverse current under low internal pH. Here, we address the molecular basis for this asymmetric conduction by investigating the structure and dynamics of a mutant channel, W41F, which permits reverse current under low internal pH. Solid-state NMR experiments show that W41F M2 retains the pH-dependent α-helical conformations and tetrameric structure of the wild-type (WT) channel but has significantly altered protonation and tautomeric equilibria at H37. At high pH, the H37 structure is shifted toward the π tautomer and less cationic tetrads, consistent with faster forward deprotonation to the C terminus. At low pH, the mutant channel contains more cationic tetrads than the WT channel, consistent with faster reverse protonation from the C terminus. 15N NMR spectra allow the extraction of four H37 pKas and show that the pKas are more clustered in the mutant channel compared to WT M2. Moreover, binding of the antiviral drug, amantadine, at the N-terminal pore at low pH did not convert all histidines to the neutral state, as seen in WT M2, but left half of all histidines cationic, unambiguously demonstrating C-terminal protonation of H37 in the mutant. These results indicate that asymmetric conduction in WT M2 is due to W41 inhibition of C-terminal acid activation by H37. When Trp is replaced by Phe, protons can be transferred to H37 bidirectionally with distinct rate constants.

Abstract The partitioning of small molecules in cell membranes---a key parameter for pharmaceutical applications---typically relies on experimentally-available bulk partitioning coefficients. Computer simulations provide a structural resolution of the insertion thermodynamics via the potential of mean force, but require significant sampling at the atomistic level. Here, we introduce high-throughput coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to screen thermodynamic properties. This application of physics based models in a large-scale study of small molecules establishes linear relationships between partitioning coefficients and key features of the potential of mean force. This allows us to predict the structure of the insertion from bulk experimental measurements for more than 400,000 compounds. The potential of mean force hereby becomes an easily accessible quantity---already recognized for its high predictability of certain properties, e.g., passive permeation. Further, we demonstrate how coarse graining helps reduce the size of chemical space, enabling a hierarchical approach to screening small molecules.

We describe and implement a computer-assisted approach for accelerating the exploration of uncharted effective free-energy surfaces (FESs). More generally, the aim is the extraction of coarse-grained, macroscopic information from stochastic or atomistic simulations, such as molecular dynamics (MD). The approach functionally links the MD simulator with nonlinear manifold learning techniques. The added value comes from biasing the simulator toward unexplored phase-space regions by exploiting the smoothness of the gradually revealed intrinsic low-dimensional geometry of the FES.

Buckling Under Pressure: Curvature-Based Lipid Segregation and Stability Modulation in Cardiolipin-Containing Bilayers.
Boyd KJ, Alder NN, May ER. 
Abstract. Mitochondrial metabolic function is affected by the morphology and protein organization of the mitochondrial inner membrane. Cardiolipin (CL) is a unique tetra-acyl lipid that is involved in the maintenance of the highly curved shape of the mitochondrial inner membrane as well as spatial organization of the proteins necessary for respiration and oxidative phosphorylation. Cardiolipin has been suggested to self-organize into lipid domains due to its inverted conical molecular geometry, though the driving forces for this organization are not fully understood. In this work, we use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to study the mechanical properties and lipid dynamics in heterogeneous bilayers both with and without CL, as a function of membrane curvature. We find that incorporation of CL increases bilayer deformability and that CL becomes highly enriched in regions of high negative curvature. We further show that another mitochondrial inverted conical lipid, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), does not partition or increase the deformability of the membrane in a significant manner. Therefore, CL appears to possess some unique characteristics that cannot be inferred simply from molecular geometry considerations.

Abstract Collective variable (CV) or order parameter based enhanced sampling algorithms have achieved great success due to their ability to efficiently explore the rough potential energy landscapes of complex systems. However, the degeneracy of microscopic configurations, originating from the orthogonal space perpendicular to the CVs, is likely to shadow ""hidden barriers"" and greatly reduce the efficiency of CV-based sampling. Here we demonstrate that systematic machine learning CV, through enhanced sampling, can iteratively lift such degeneracies on the fly. We introduce an active learning scheme that consists of a parametric CV learner based on deep neural network and a CV-based enhanced sampler. Our active enhanced sampling (AES) algorithm is capable of identifying the least informative regions based on a historical sample, forming a positive feedback loop between the CV leaner and sampler. This approach is able to globally preserve kinetic characteristics by incrementally enhancing both sample completeness and CV quality.","Computational Biochemistry—Enzyme Mechanisms Explored,

Understanding enzyme mechanisms is a major task to achieve in order to comprehend how living cells work. Recent advances in biomolecular research provide huge amount of data on enzyme kinetics and structure. The analysis of diverse experimental results and their combination into an overall picture is, however, often challenging. Microscopic details of the enzymatic processes are often anticipated based on several hints from macroscopic experimental data. Computational biochemistry aims at creation of a computational model of an enzyme in order to explain microscopic details of the catalytic process and reproduce or predict macroscopic experimental findings. Results of such computations are in part complementary to experimental data and provide an explanation of a biochemical process at the microscopic level. In order to evaluate the mechanism of an enzyme, a structural model is constructed which can be analyzed by several theoretical approaches. Several simulation methods can and should be combined to get a reliable picture of the process of interest. Furthermore, abstract models of biological systems can be constructed combining computational and experimental data. In this review, we discuss structural computational models of enzymatic systems. We first discuss various models to simulate enzyme catalysis. Furthermore, we review various approaches how to characterize the enzyme mechanism both qualitatively and quantitatively using different modeling approaches.

Abstract Markov state models (MSMs) and other related kinetic network models are frequently used to study the long-timescale dynamical behavior of biomolecular and materials systems. MSMs are often constructed bottom-up using brute-force molecular dynamics (MD) simulations when the model contains a large number of states and kinetic pathways that are not known a priori. However, the resulting network generally encompasses only parts of the configurational space, and regardless of any additional MD performed, several states and pathways will still remain missing. This implies that the duration for which the MSM can faithfully capture the true dynamics, which we term as the validity time for the MSM, is always finite and unfortunately much shorter than the MD time invested to construct the model. A general framework that relates the kinetic uncertainty in the model to the validity time, missing states and pathways, network topology, and statistical sampling is presented. Performing additional calculations for frequently-sampled states/pathways may not alter the MSM validity time. A new class of enhanced kinetic sampling techniques is introduced that aims at targeting rare states/pathways that contribute most to the uncertainty so that the validity time is boosted in an effective manner. Examples including straightforward 1D energy landscapes, lattice models, and biomolecular systems are provided to illustrate the application of the method. Developments presented here will be of interest to the kinetic Monte Carlo community as well.

Simple pair-wise potentials for five alkali ions and four halide ions were developed by only fitting to ab initio MP2 forces with the adaptive force matching (AFM) method. Without fitting to any experimental information, the AFM models predict the hydration free energies of all 10 fluoride and chloride salts formed by these ions within 1.5% of experimental reference. The predicted hydration free energies for the 10 bromide and iodide salts are within 5-6% of experimental references with the larger error likely due to the neglect of explicit treatment of polarization and charge transfer. An inconsistency in the treatment of the gas phase entropy term between experimental and theoretical approaches is discussed. A new simplified hydration free energy for the ions is reported for use as a more appropriate experimental reference for further theoretical studies. The simulations show different dipole alignment for the hydration waters of cations and anions. While hydration waters of small cations tend to align their molecular dipole toward the ion, the dipole of one of the water OH bonds is aligned with the field of an anion.

Connecting Protein Conformation and Dynamics with Ligand-Receptor Binding Using Three-Color FRET Tracking.

Abstract. Specific binding between biomolecules, i.e., molecular recognition, controls virtually all biological processes including the interactions between cells and biointerfaces, both natural and synthetic. Such binding often relies on the conformation of biomacromolecules, which can be highly heterogeneous and sensitive to environmental perturbations, and therefore difficult to characterize and control. An approach is demonstrated here that directly connects the binding kinetics and stability of the protein receptor integrin αvβ3 to the conformation of the ligand fibronectin (FN), which are believed to control cellular mechanosensing. Specifically, we investigated the influence of surface-adsorbed FN structure and dynamics on αvβ3 binding using high-throughput single-molecule three-color FRET tracking methods. By controlling FN structure and dynamics through tuning surface chemistry, we found that as the conformational and translational dynamics of FN increased, the rate of binding, particularly to folded FN, and stability of the bound FN-αvβ3 complex decreased significantly. These findings highlight the importance of the conformational plasticity and accessibility of the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) binding site in FN, which, in turn, mediate cell signaling in physiological and synthetic environments.

Abstract We consider a coarse-grained (CG) model with pairwise interactions, suitable to describe low-density solutions of star-branched polymers of functionality f.

Potentials are obtained by requiring the CG model to reproduce a set of distribution functions computed in the microscopic model in the zero-density limit. Explicit results are given for f=6,12 and 40. We use the CG model to compute the osmotic equation of state of the solution for concentrations c such that Φp=c/c∗≲1, where c∗ is the overlap concentration. We also investigate in detail the phase diagram for f=40, identifying the boundaries of the solid intermediate phase. Finally, we investigate how the polymer size changes with c. For Φp≲0.3 polymers become harder as f increases at fixed reduced concentration c/c∗. On the other hand, for Φp≳0.3, polymers show the opposite behavior: At fixed Φp, the larger the value of f, the larger their size reduction is.","Quantum dynamics with short-time trajectories and minimal adaptive basis sets

Methods for solving the time-dependent Schrodinger equation via basis set expansion of the wavefunction can generally be categorised as having either static (time-independent) or dynamic (time-dependent) basis functions. We have recently introduced an alternative simulation approach which represents a middle road between these two extremes, employing dynamic (classical-like) trajectories to create a static basis set of Gaussian wavepackets in regions of phase-space relevant to future propagation of the wavefunction [J. Chem. Theory Comput., 11, 8 (2015)]. Here, we propose and test a modification of our methodology which aims to reduce the size of basis sets generated in our original scheme. In particular, we employ short-time classical trajectories to continuously generate new basis functions for short-time quantum propagation of the wavefunction; to avoid the continued growth of the basis set describing the time-dependent wavefunction, we employ Matching Pursuit to periodically minimize the number of basis functions required to accurately describe the wavefunction. Overall, this approach generates a basis set which is adapted to evolution of the wavefunction whilst also being as small as possible. In applications to challenging benchmark problems, namely a 4-dimensional model of photoexcited pyrazine and three different double-well tunnelling problems, we find that our new scheme enables accurate wavefunction propagation with basis sets which are around an order-of-magnitude smaller than our original trajectory-guided basis set methodology, highlighting the benefits of adaptive strategies for wavefunction propagation.","Title: Coarse-Grained Model of the Demixing of DNA and Non-Binding Globular Macromolecules

Abstract The volume occupied by the unconstrained genomic DNA of prokaryotes in saline solutions is thousand times larger than the cell. Moreover, it is not separated from the rest of the cell by a membrane. Nevertheless, it occupies only a small fraction of the cell called the nucleoid. The mechanisms leading to such compaction are the matter of ongoing debates. The present work aims at exploring a newly proposed mechanism, according to which the formation of the nucleoid would result from the demixing of the DNA and nonbinding globular macromolecules of the cytoplasm, like ribosomes. To this end, a coarsegrained model of prokaryotic cells was developed and demixing was analyzed as a function of the size and number of crowders. The model suggests that compaction of the DNA is actually governed by the volume occupancy ratio of the crowders and remains weak almost up to the jamming critical density. Strong compaction is however observed just before jamming, suggesting that crowding and electrostatic repulsion work synergetically in this limit. Finally, simulations performed with crowders with different sizes indicate that the DNA and the largest crowders demix preferentially. Together with the recent observation of the gradual compaction of long DNA molecules upon increase of the concentration of BSA proteins and silica nanoparticles, this work supports the demixing mechanism as a key player for the formation of the nucleoid.",,"Flexible Force Field Parameterization through Fitting on the Ab Initio derived Elastic Tensor

Constructing functional forms and their corresponding force field parameters for the metal-linker interface of metal-organic frameworks is challenging. We propose to fit these parameters on the elastic tensor, computed from ab initio density functional theory calculations. The advantage of this top-down approach is that it becomes evident if functional forms are missing when components of the elastic tensor are off. As a proof-of-concept, a new flexible force field for MIL-47(V) is derived. Negative thermal expansion is observed and framework flexibility has a negligible effect on adsorption and transport properties for small guest molecules. We believe this force field parameterization approach can serve as a useful tool for developing accurate flexible force field models that capture the correct mechanical behavior of the full periodic structure.

Abstract Structural dissimilarity sampling (SDS) has been proposed as an enhanced conformational sampling method for reproducing the structural transitions of a given protein. SDS consists of cycles of two steps: (1) Selections of initial structures with structural dissimilarities by referring to a measure. (2) Conformational resampling by restarting short-time molecular dynamics (MD) simulations from the initial structures. In the present study, an efficient measure is proposed as a dynamically self-guiding selection to accelerate the structural transitions from a reactant state to a product state as an extension to the original SDS. In the extended SDS, the inner product (IP) between the reactant and the snapshots generated by short-time MD simulations are evaluated and ranked according to the IPs at every cycle. Then, the snapshots with low IPs are selected as initial structures for the short-time MD simulations. This scheme enables one to choose dissimilar and distant initial structures from the reactant, and thus the initial structures dynamically head towards the product, promoting structural transitions from the reactant. To confirm the conformational sampling efficiency, the extended SDS was applied to maltodextrin binding protein (MBP), and we successfully reproduced the structural transition from the open to closed states with submicrosecond-order simulation times. However, a conventional long-time MD simulation failed to reproduce the same structural transition. We also compared the performance with that obtained by the ordinary SDS and other sampling techniques that have been developed by us to characterize the possible utility of the extended SDS for actual applications.","Zhang, Yuwei, Zexing Cao, and Fei Xia.

In this work, we attempt to construct a UCG model with a classical Gō-like potential. The heterogeneous parameters of local and nonlocal interactions in the energy potential function are derived by using fluctuation matching method. The simulated results with UCG models indicate that it could reproduce the root mean square fluctuations as accurate as that of long-time all-atom simulations. Therefore, the UCG model has great potential in the simulation of huge biological systems such as biomaterials.

Despite the quantum nature of molecules, classical mechanics is often employed to describe molecular motions that play a fundamental role in a wide range of phenomena including chemical reactions. This is due to the need of assigning well-defined positions to the atomic nuclei during the time evolution of the system in order to describe unambiguously the molecular motions, whereas quantum mechanics provides information on probabilistic nature only. One would like to employ a quantum molecular trajectory that defines rigorously the instantaneous nuclear positions and, simultaneously, guarantees the conservation of all quantum mechanics predictions unlike the classical trajectory. We argue that such a quantum molecular trajectory can be formally defined and we prove that it corresponds to a single Bohm trajectory. Our analysis establishes a clear correspondence between the statistical properties of the trajectory and the quantum expectation values. The obvious and undeniable benefit is that of dealing with a quantum methodology fully characterizing the molecular motions without any reference to classical mechanics.","Coalescence of nanoclusters analyzed by Well-Tempered Metadynamics.

The coalescence process of two nanoparticles to yield a core-shell structure is analyzed by a Well-Tempered Metadynamics procedure. This methodology shows to be useful to understand the present phenomenon in terms of two collective variables: the distance between the center of mass of the coalescing particles and the gyration radius of the resulting core element. The free-energy contour plots clearly show that the coalescence process involves the deformation of the core material, which is manifested in the residence of the system in regions with a larger gyration radius. Results from molecular dynamics for the same system were found helpful to reach the definition of this second collective variable. The advantages and limitations of the latter approach are discussed.

Abstract. Hydrophobic amino acids are abundant in transmembrane (TM) helices of membrane proteins. Charged residues are sparse, apparently due to the unfavorable energetic cost of partitioning charges into nonpolar phases. Nevertheless, conserved arginine residues within TM helices regulate vital functions, such as ion channel voltage gating and integrin receptor inactivation. The energetic cost of arginine in various positions along hydrophobic helices has been controversial. Potential of mean force (PMF) calculations from atomistic molecular dynamics simulations predict very large energetic penalties, while in vitro experiments with Sec61 translocons indicate much smaller penalties, even for arginine in the center of hydrophobic TM helices. Resolution of this conflict has proved difficult, because the in vitro assay utilizes the complex Sec61 translocon, while the PMF calculations rely on the choice of simulation system and reaction coordinate. Here we present the results of computational and experimental studies that permit direct comparison with the Sec61 translocon results. We find that the Sec61 translocon mediates less efficient membrane insertion of Arg-containing TM helices compared with our computational and experimental bilayer-insertion results. In the simulations, a combination of arginine snorkeling, bilayer deformation, and peptide tilting is sufficient to lower the penalty of Arg insertion to an extent such that a hydrophobic TM helix with a central Arg residue readily inserts into a model membrane. Less favorable insertion by the translocon may be due to the decreased fluidity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane compared with pure palmitoyloleoyl-phosphocholine (POPC). Nevertheless, our results provide an explanation for the differences between PMF- and experiment-based penalties for Arg burial.","Meyer, Hugues, Thomas Voigtmann, and Tanja Schilling.

We present a method to compute the time-dependent memory kernel of a generalized Langevin equation on the basis of molecular dynamics simulations of the underlying microscopic dynamics. The method allows to numerically obtain the coarse-grained dynamics of a system under full non-equilibrium conditions by sampling the instantaneous correlation functions of the variable of interest with its time derivatives. The method does not require time-scale separation, thus the variable does neither need to be ""slow"" nor ""macroscopic"". The method can be used, for instance, to test the Markovian approximation that is often made in simulations on the coarse-grained scale.","The entropy of a complex molecule
Gérôme Faure and Rafael Delgado-Buscalioni and Pep Español The Journal of Chemical Physics 2017, 146, 22, 224106 10.1063/1.4984965
Entropy is a central concept in the theory of coarse-graining. Through Einstein’s formula, it provides the equilibrium probability distribution of the coarse-grained variables used to describe the system of interest. We study with molecular dynamics simulations the equilibrium probability distribution of thermal blobs representing at a coarse-grained level star polymer molecules in melt. Thermal blobs are characterized by the positions and momenta of the centers of mass, and internal energies of the molecules. We show that the entropy of the level of description of thermal blobs can be very well approximated as the sum of the thermodynamic entropy of each single molecule considered as isolated thermodynamic systems. The entropy of a single molecule depends on the intrinsic energy, involving only contributions from the atoms that make the molecule and not from the interactions with atoms of other molecules.
",,"Diblock copolymer bilayers as model for polymersomes: A coarse grain approach

Grillo, Damián A., Albano, Juan M. R., Mocskos, Esteban E. ,Facelli, Julio C., Pickholz, Mónica, Ferraro, Marta B. The Journal of Chemical Physics 2017 146 24 doi: 10.1063/1.4986642

This paper presents a new model for polymersomes developed using a poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(butadiene) diblock copolymer bilayer. The model is based on a coarse-grained approach using the MARTINI force field. Since no MARTINI parameters exist for poly(butadiene), we have refined these parameters using quantum mechanical calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. The model has been validated using extensive molecular dynamics simulations in systems with several hundred polymer units and reaching up to 6 μμs. These simulations show that the copolymer coarse grain model self-assemble into bilayers and that NPT and NPNγT ensemble runs reproduce key structural and mechanical experimental properties for different copolymer length chains with a similar hydrophilic weight fraction."

Modelling apical columnar epithelium mechanics from circumferential contractile fibres
Boyd AR, Moore S, Sader JE, Lee PV
Abstract. Simple columnar epithelia are formed by individual epithelial cells connecting together to form single cell high sheets. They are a main component of many important body tissues and are heavily involved in both normal and cancerous cell activities. Prior experimental observations have identified a series of contractile fibres around the circumference of a cross section located in the upper (apical) region of each cell. While other potential mechanisms have been identified in both the experimental and theoretical literature, these circumferential fibres are considered to be the most likely mechanism controlling movement of this cross section. Here, we investigated the impact of circumferential contractile fibres on movement of the cross section by creating an alternate model where movement is driven from circumferential contractile fibres, without any other potential mechanisms. In this model, we utilised a circumferential contractile fibre representation based on investigations into the movement of contractile fibres as an individual system, treated circumferential fibres as a series of units, and matched our modelsimulation to experimental geometries. By testing against laser ablation datasets sourced from existing literature, we found that circumferential fibres can reproduce the majority of cross-sectional movements. We also investigated model predictions related to various aspects of cross-sectional movement, providing insights into epithelium mechanics and demonstrating the usefulness of our modelling approach.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00185

The membrane tubulation induced by Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) superfamily proteins is investigated by using coarse-grained meshless membrane simulations. The tubulation is enhanced by laterally isotropic membrane inclusions that generate the same sign of spontaneous curvature as the adsorbed BAR proteins. The inclusions are concentrated in the tubules and reduce the bending energy of the tip of the tubules. On the other hand, the inclusions with an opposite curvature suppress the tubulation by percolated-network formation at a high BAR density while they induce a spherical membrane bud at a low BAR density. When equal amounts of the two types of inclusions (with positive and negative curvatures) are added, their effects cancel each other for the first short period but later the tubulation is slowly accelerated. A positive surface tension suppresses the tubulation.","Free Energy Reconstruction from Logarithmic Mean-Force Dynamics using Multiple Nonequilibrium Trajectories
Tetsuya Morishita, Yasushige Yonezawa, and Atsushi M Ito Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation Just Accepted Manuscript DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00252
Efficient and reliable estimation of the mean-force (MF), the derivatives of the free-energy with respect to a set of collective variables (CVs), has been a challenging problem, since free-energy differences are often computed by integrating the MF. Among various methods for computing free-energy differences, logarithmic mean-force dynamics (LogMFD) [T. Morishita et al., Phys. Rev. E 2012, 85, 066702] invokes the conservation law in classical mechanics to integrate the MF, which allows us to estimate the free-energy profile along the CVs on-the-fly. Here, we present a method called parallel-dynamics, which improves the estimation of the MF by employing multiple replicas of the system and is straightforwardly incorporated in LogMFD or a related method. In the parallel-dynamics, the MF is evaluated by a nonequilibrium path-ensemble using the multiple replicas based on the Crooks-Jarzynski nonequilibrium work relation. Thanks to the Crooks relation, realizing full-equilibrium states is no longer mandatory for estimating the MF. Additionally, sampling in the hidden subspace orthogonal to the CV-space is highly improved with appropriate weights for each metastable state (if any), which is hardly achievable by typical free-energy computational methods. We illustrate how to implement parallel-dynamics, by combining it with LogMFD, which we call logarithmic parallel-dynamics (LogPD). Biosystems of alanine dipeptide and adenylate kinase in explicit water are employed as benchmark systems, to which LogPD is applied to demonstrate the effect of multiple replicas on the accuracy and efficiency in estimating the free-energy profiles using parallel-dynamics.",,"Title: Kinetics from Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics Simulations

Authors: Lukas S. Stelzl and Gerhard Hummer

Abstract: Transitions between metastable states govern many fundamental processes in physics, chemistry, and biology, from nucleation events in phase transitions to the folding of proteins. The free energy surfaces underlying these processes can be obtained from simulations using enhanced sampling methods. However, their altered dynamics makes kinetic and mechanistic information difficult or impossible to extract. Here we show that with replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD), one can not only sample equilibrium properties, but also extract kinetic information. For systems that strictly obey first-order kinetics, the procedure to extract rates is rigorous. For actual molecular systems whose long-time dynamics is captured by kinetic rate models, accurate rate coefficients can be determined from the statistics of the transitions between the metastable states at each replica temperatures. We demonstrate the practical applicability of the procedure by constructing master equation (Markov state) models of peptide and RNA folding from REMD simulations.

A coarse-grained model for assisting the investigation of structure and dynamics of large nucleic acids by ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry
Vangaveti S, D'Esposito RJ, Lippens JL, Fabris D, Ranganathan SV
Abstract. Ion Mobility Spectrometry-Mass Spectrometry (IMS-MS) is a rapidly emerging tool for the investigation of nucleic acid structure and dynamics. IMS-MS determinations can provide valuable information regarding alternative topologies, folding intermediates, and conformational heterogeneities, which are not readily accessible to other analytical techniques. The leading strategies for data interpretation rely on computational and experimental approaches to correctly assign experimental observations to putative structures. A very effective strategy involves the application of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to predict the structure of the analyte molecule, calculate its collision cross section (CCS), and then compare this computational value with the corresponding experimental data. While this approach works well for small nucleic acid species, analyzing larger nucleic acids of biological interest is hampered by the computational cost associated with capturing their extensive structure and dynamics in all-atom detail. In this report, we describe the implementation of a coarse graining (CG) approach to reduce the cost of the computational methods employed in the data interpretation workflow. Our framework employs a five-bead model to accurately represent each nucleotide in the nucleic acid structure. The beads are appropriately parameterized to enable the direct calculation of CCS values from CG models, thus affording the ability to pursue the analysis of larger, highly dynamic constructs. The validity of this approach was successfully confirmed by the excellent correlation between the CCS values obtained in parallel by all-atom and CG workflows.

Supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) have been widely used in drug delivery, biosensors and biomimetic membranes. The microscopic mechanism of SLB formation and stability depends on a number of factors underlying solvent-mediated lipid-lipid and lipid-substrate interactions. Whereas recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in understanding the kinetics of SLB formation, relatively little is known about the lipid phase behavior controlling SLB stability under diverse solution conditions. In this work, we examine SLB structure using the classical density functional theory (CDFT) in the context of a coarse-grained model that accounts for ion-explicit electrostatic interactions, surface hydrophobicity, as well as the molecular characteristics of the lipid tails. A morphological phase diagram is constructed in terms of various intrinsic properties of lipid molecules (such as lipid tail length, the size and charge of the lipid head segments), substrate conditions (such as surface charge density and hydrophobicity), and solution parameters (such as ion concentration and ion type). The morphological phase diagram provides useful insights towards rational design and broader application of SLB membranes as different types of nano-devices.","Quantum Dynamics with Short-Time Trajectories and Minimal Adaptive Basis Sets
Maximilian A. C. Saller and Scott Habershon Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation Article ASAP DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00021
Methods for solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation via basis set expansion of the wave function can generally be categorized as having either static (time-independent) or dynamic (time-dependent) basis functions. We have recently introduced an alternative simulation approach which represents a middle road between these two extremes, employing dynamic (classical-like) trajectories to create a static basis set of Gaussian wavepackets in regions of phase-space relevant to future propagation of the wave function [J. Chem. Theory Comput., 11, 8 (2015)]. Here, we propose and test a modification of our methodology which aims to reduce the size of basis sets generated in our original scheme. In particular, we employ short-time classical trajectories to continuously generate new basis functions for short-time quantum propagation of the wave function; to avoid the continued growth of the basis set describing the time-dependent wave function, we employ Matching Pursuit to periodically minimize the number of basis functions required to accurately describe the wave function. Overall, this approach generates a basis set which is adapted to evolution of the wave function while also being as small as possible. In applications to challenging benchmark problems, namely a 4-dimensional model of photoexcited pyrazine and three different double-well tunnelling problems, we find that our new scheme enables accurate wave function propagation with basis sets which are around an order-of-magnitude smaller than our original trajectory-guided basis set methodology, highlighting the benefits of adaptive strategies for wave function propagation.","Some connections between importance sampling and enhanced sampling methods in molecular dynamics
H. C. Lie and J. Quer
The Journal of Chemical Physics 147, 194107 (2017); 

In molecular dynamics, enhanced sampling methods enable the collection of better statistics of rare events from a reference or target distribution. We show that a large class of these methods is based on the idea of importance sampling from mathematical statistics. We illustrate this connection by comparing the Hartmann-Schütte method for rare event simulation (J. Stat. Mech. Theor. Exp. 2012, P11004) and the Valsson-Parrinello method of variationally enhanced sampling [Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 090601 (2014)]. We use this connection in order to discuss how recent results from the Monte Carlo methods literature can guide the development of enhanced sampling methods.

Authors: Daniel Havelka, Marco A. Deriu, Michal Cifra and Ondřej Kučera

Abstract: The mechanical properties of microtubules are of great importance for understanding their biological function and for applications in artificial devices. Although microtubule mechanics has been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally, the relation to its molecular structure is understood only partially. Here, we report on the structural analysis of microtubule vibration modes calculated by an atomistic approach. Molecular dynamics was applied to refine the atomic structure of a microtubule and a C α elastic network model was analyzed for its normal modes. We mapped fluctuations and local deformations up to the level of individual aminoacid residues. The deformation is mode-shape dependent and principally different in α-tubulins and β-tubulins. Parts of the tubulin dimer sequence responding specifically to longitudinal and radial stress are identified. We show that substantial strain within a microtubule is located both in the regions of contact between adjacent dimers and in the body of tubulins. Our results provide supportive evidence for the generally accepted assumption that the mechanics of microtubules, including its anisotropy, is determined by the bonds between tubulins.

The present paper is focussed on the characterization of the properties of methanol and water molecules in gas and liquid enviroments. A force field for methanol-methanol and methanol-water interactions, useful to be applied in Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, is proposed. The elec- trostatic interaction contributions, arising from permanent charge and/or from anisotropic charge distributions originating permanent electric multipoles (Vel), different in gas and in liquid phase, are combined with the non electrostatic ones (Vnel), defined by means of Improved Lennard- Jones (ILJ) functions [Pirani et al., Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2008, (10), 5489]. Interestingly, the relevant parameters of the ILJ functions are not fitted to reproduce selected properties of the systems but calculated from the molecular polarizability, which is considered the key property to define size (or Pauli) repulsion and dispersion and induction attractions.The constructed force field predicts binding energies and geometries for the methanol-methanol and methanol-water dimers, in good agreement with available data. On another hand, several bulk and structural properties of liquid methanol, as densities, vaporization enthalpies, diffusion coefficients, coefficient of cu- bic thermal expansion, heat capacities at constant pressure and some relevant radial distribution functions, calculated considering 2744 molecules and different conditions of pressure and tem- perature, have been also found in good agreement with experimental data. The study has been completed by calculating the density at 298 K and 1 bar of some methanol-water mixtures, which have been also found in a good agreement with experimental data.","Exploring Solvation Effects in Ligand-Exchange Reactions via Static and Dynamic Methods

DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00214
We investigate ligand-exchange reactions of a biomimetic Co(II)-based heterocubane complex in aqueous solution by means of various approaches for consideration of solvent effects. Static calculations based on geometry optimizations carried out in vacuum, with solvent continuum models, or with several explicit solvent molecules have been carried out as well as density functional theory (DFT)-based molecular dynamics simulations. In addition, reaction pathways and barriers have been elucidated via nudged elastic band calculations and metadynamics. The results show that static approaches with approximate consideration of the solvent environment lead to reaction energies, which may change drastically depending on the method employed. A more sophisticated approach is DFT-molecular dynamics at ambient conditions with full solvation, i.e. enough solvent molecules to retain bulk water properties far from the solute, which, however, comes with a much higher computational cost. The investigated example of the exchange of an acetate ligand by a hydroxide demonstrates that entropic contributions can be vital and consideration of electronic energies alone may be a rather rough approximation.",,"Title: The contribution of a nucleocapsid core to viral budding

Authors: Guillermo R. Lazaro, Suchetana Mukhopadhyay and Michael F. Hagan

Abstract: During the lifecycle of many enveloped viruses, a nucleocapsid core buds through the cell membrane to acquire an outer envelope of lipid membrane and viral glycoproteins. However, the nucleocapsid core is not required for assembly of infectious particles. To determine the role of the nucleocapsid, we perform coarse-grained computational modeling of budding in the presence and absence of a nucleocapsid. The simulations demonstrate that glycoprotein-directed budding leads to larger and more polydisperse particles than nucleocapsid-directed budding. This polydispersity is explained by a theoretical model for the competition between bending energy of the membrane and the glycoprotein shell. The simulations also show that the geometry of a budding particle impedes glycoprotein diffusion, which can result in a stalled, partially budded state. We present a phase diagram for morphologies of budded particles, which can be compared against experiments to establish bounds on whether budding is directed by glycoprotein or nucleocapsid interactions.

We consider a classical and possibly driven composite system X⊗Y weakly coupled to a Markovian thermal reservoir R so that an unambiguous stochastic thermodynamics ensues for X⊗Y. This setup can be equivalently seen as a system X strongly coupled to a non-Markovian reservoir Y⊗R. We demonstrate that only in the limit where the dynamics of Y is much faster than X, our unambiguous expressions for thermodynamic quantities, such as heat, entropy, or internal energy, are equivalent to the strong coupling expressions recently obtained in the literature using the Hamiltonian of mean force. By doing so, we also significantly extend these results by formulating them at the level of instantaneous rates and by allowing for time-dependent couplings between X and its environment. Away from the limit where Y evolves much faster than X, previous approaches fail to reproduce the correct results from the original unambiguous formulation, as we illustrate numerically for an underdamped Brownian particle coupled strongly to a non-Markovian reservoir.",,,

The spatial dimensions and the stiffness (characteristic ratio, C∞) of polymer chains are intimately related to key macroscopic properties such as the plateau modulus and the melt viscosity. Furthermore, these molecular features are very important in the selection and design of copolymer species used in directed self-assembly lithographic processes. We have developed a general methodology for predicting the chain dimensions of any polymer chain in the unperturbed state starting from its detailed atomistic structure. The methodology is based on performing Metropolis Monte Carlo (MC) simulation, leading to equilibration of the conformational distribution of a single unperturbed polymer chain, subject only to local interactions along its backbone. To define what constitutes local interactions, the maximal topological distance of repeat units between which nonbonded forces are active is varied systematically, until a maximum in stiffness is achieved. Our methodology was validated by comparing the predicted characteristic ratios for a series of polymers against the corresponding values estimated from MC simulations of the same polymers in the melt state based on the same force field. Furthermore, we have predicted the characteristic ratios for three polymers used in directed self-assembly lithographic processes and shown that they are in good agreement with reported experimental values.

Abstract: Metadynamics is a powerful enhanced molecular dynamics sampling method that accelerates simulations by adding history-dependent multi-dimensional Gaussians along selective collective variables (CVs). In practice, choosing a small number of slow CVs remains challenging due to the inherent high dimensionality of biophysical systems. Here we show that time-structure based independent component analysis (tICA), a recent advance in Markov state model literature, can be used to identify a set of variationally optimal slow coordinates for use as CVs for Metadynamics. We show that linear and non-linear tICA-Metadynamics can complement existing MD studies by explicitly sampling the system’s slowest modes, and can even drive transitions along the slowest modes even when no such transitions are observed in unbiased simulations.

Abstract: Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) has rapidly emerged as a powerful tool to investigate the internal, three-dimensional spatial organization of the cell. In parallel, the GPU-based technology to perform spatially resolved stochastic simulations of whole cells has arisen, allowing the simulation of complex biochemical networks over cell cycle time scales using data taken from -omics, single molecule experiments, and in vitro kinetics. By using real cell geometry derived from cryo-ET data, we have the opportunity to imbue these highly detailed structural data—frozen in time—with realistic biochemical dynamics and investigate how cell structure affects the behavior of the embedded chemical reaction network. Here we present two examples to illustrate the challenges and techniques involved in integrating structural data into stochastic simulations. First, a tomographic reconstruction of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is used to construct the geometry of an entire cell through which a simple stochastic model of an inducible genetic switch is studied. Second, a tomogram of the nuclear periphery in a HeLa cell is converted directly to the simulation geometry through which we study the effects of cellular substructure on the stochastic dynamics of gene repression. These simple chemical models allow us to illustrate how to build whole-cell simulations using cryo-ET derived geometry and the challenges involved in such a process.

"Title: Multistage modeling of protein dynamics with monomeric Myc oncoprotein as an example

Authors: Jiaojiao Liu, Jin Dai, Jianfeng He, Antti J. Niemi, and Nevena Ilieva

Abstract: We propose to combine a mean-field approach with all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) into a multistage algorithm that can model protein folding and dynamics over very long time periods yet with atomic-level precision. As an example, we investigate an isolated monomeric Myc oncoprotein that has been implicated in carcinomas including those in colon, breast, and lungs. Under physiological conditions a monomeric Myc is presumed to be an example of intrinsically disordered proteins that pose a serious challenge to existing modeling techniques. We argue that a room-temperature monomeric Myc is in a dynamical state, it oscillates between different conformations that we identify. For this we adopt the Cα backbone of Myc in a crystallographic heteromer as an initial ansatz for the monomeric structure. We construct a multisoliton of the pertinent Landau free energy to describe the Cα profile with ultrahigh precision. We use Glauber dynamics to resolve how the multisoliton responds to repeated increases and decreases in ambient temperature. We confirm that the initial structure is unstable in isolation. We reveal a highly degenerate ground-state landscape, an attractive set towards which Glauber dynamics converges in the limit of vanishing ambient temperature. We analyze the thermal stability of this Glauber attractor using room-temperature molecular dynamics. We identify and scrutinize a particularly stable subset in which the two helical segments of the original multisoliton align in parallel next to each other. During the MD time evolution of a representative structure from this subset, we observe intermittent quasiparticle oscillations along the C-terminal α-helix, some of which resemble a translating Davydov's Amide-I soliton. We propose that the presence of oscillatory motion is in line with the expected intrinsically disordered character of Myc.

Authors: Jing Li and Timothy A. Springer

Abstract: Integrins undergo large-scale conformational changes upon activation. Signaling events driving integrin activation have previously been discussed conceptually, but not quantitatively. Here, recent measurements of the intrinsic ligand-binding affinity and free energy of each integrin conformational state on the cell surface, together with the length scales of conformational change, are used to quantitatively compare models of activation. We examine whether binding of cytoskeletal adaptors to integrin cytoplasmic domains is sufficient for activation or whether exertion of tensile force by the actin cytoskeleton across the integrin–ligand complex is also required. We find that only the combination of adaptor binding and cytoskeletal force provides ultrasensitive regulation. Moreover, switch-like activation by force depends on the large, >130 Å length-scale change in integrin extension, which is well tailored to match the free-energy difference between the inactive (bent-closed) and active (extended-open) conformations. The length scale and energy cost in integrin extension enable activation by force in the low pN range and appear to be the key specializations that enable cell adhesion through integrins to be coordinated with cytoskeletal dynamics.

Riggleman, Field-theoretic simulations of block copolymer nano composites in a constant interfacial tension ensemble, J. Chem. Phys., 146, 164903 (2017)

Abstract: Block copolymers, due to their ability to self-assemble into periodic structures with long range order, are appealing candidates to control the ordering of functionalized nanoparticles where it is well-accepted that the spatial distribution of nanoparticles in a polymer matrix dictates the resulting material properties. The large parameter space associated with block copolymer nanocomposites makes theory and simulation tools appealing to guide experiments and effectively isolate parameters of interest. We demonstrate a method for performing field-theoretic simulations in a constant volume-constant interfacial tension ensemble (nVγT) that enables the determination of the equilibrium properties of block copolymer nanocomposites,including when the composites are placed under tensile or compressive loads. Our approach is compatible with the complex Langevin simulation framework, which allows us to go beyond the mean-field approximation. We validate our approach by comparing our nVγT approach with free energycalculations to determine the ideal domain spacing and modulus of a symmetric block copolymer melt. We analyzethe effect of numerical and thermodynamic parameters on the efficiency of the nVγT ensemble and subsequently use our method to investigate the ideal domain spacing, modulus, and nanoparticle distribution of a lamellar forming block copolymer nanocomposite. We find that the nanoparticledistribution is directly linked to the resultant domain spacing and is dependent on polymer chain density, nanoparticlesize, and nanoparticle chemistry. Furthermore, placing the system under tension or compression can qualitatively alter the nanoparticle distribution within the block copolymer.",
"Title: Effectively explore metastable states of proteins by adaptive nonequilibrium driving simulations

Authors: Biao Wan, Shun Xu, and Xin Zhou

Abstract: Nonequilibrium drivings applied in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can efficiently extend the visiting range of protein conformations, but might compel systems to go far away from equilibrium and thus mainly explore irrelevant conformations. Here we propose a general method, called adaptive nonequilibrium simulation (ANES), to automatically adjust the external driving on the fly, based on the feedback of the short-time average response of system. Thus, the ANES approximately keeps the local equilibrium but efficiently accelerates the global motion. We illustrate the capability of the ANES in highly efficiently exploring metastable conformations in the deca-alanine peptide and find that the 0.2−μs ANES approximately captures the important states and folding and unfolding pathways in the HP35 solution by comparing with the result of the recent 398−μs equilibrium MD simulation on Anton [S. Piana et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 109, 17845 (2012)].

Flexible fitting is a computational algorithm to derive a new
conformational model that conforms to low-resolution experimental data
by transforming a known structure. A common application is against
data from cryo-electron microscopy to obtain conformational models in
new functional states. The conventional flexible fitting algorithms
cannot derive correct structures in some cases due to the complexity
of conformational transitions. In this study, we show the importance
of conformational ensemble in the refinement process by performing
multiple fittings trials using a variety of different force constants.
Application to simulated maps of Ca2+ ATPase and diphtheria toxin as
well as experimental data of release factor 2 revealed that for these
systems, multiple conformations with similar agreement with the
density map exist and a large number of fitting trials are necessary
to generate good models. Clustering analysis can be an effective
approach to avoid over-fitting models. In addition, we show that an
automatic adjustment of the biasing force constants during the fitting
process, implemented as replica-exchange scheme, can improve the
success rate.","Title: Overcoming the limitations of the MARTINI force field in Molecular Dynamics simulations of polysaccharides

Authors: Philipp S. Schmalhorst, Felix Deluweit, Roger Scherrers, Carl-Philipp Heisenberg, Mateusz Sikora

Abstract: Polysaccharides (carbohydrates) are key regulators of a large number of cell biological processes. However, precise biochemical or genetic manipulation of these often complex structures is laborious and hampers experimental structure-function studies. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations provide a valuable alternative tool to generate and test hypotheses on saccharide function. Yet, most currently used MD force fields overstate non-bonded interactions between polysaccharide molecules, strongly limiting the usability of those simulations. Here we tested MARTINI, a popular coarse-grained (CG) force field for biological macromolecules, for its ability to accurately represent molecular forces between saccharides. To this end, we calculated a thermodynamic solution property, the second virial coefficient of the osmotic pressure (B22). Comparison with light scattering experiments revealed that MARTINI strongly overestimates non-bonded interactions for a prototypic polysaccharide, leading to unrealistic aggregation. This finding also applies to smaller oligosaccharides which were all found to aggregate in simulations even at moderate concentrations, well below their solubility limit. Finally, we explored the influence of the Lennard-Jones (LJ) interaction between saccharide molecules and propose a simple scaling of the LJ interaction strength that makes MARTINI more reliable for the simulation of saccharides.

Abstract: For accurate quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) studies of enzymatic reactions, it is desirable to include MM polarization, for example by using the Drude oscillator (DO) model.

"Rigidity Theory-Based Approximation of Vibrational Entropy Changes upon Binding to Biomolecules
Holger Gohlke, Ido Y. Ben-Shalom, Hannes Kopitz, Stefania Pfeiffer-Marek, and Karl-Heinz Baringhaus Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation Article ASAP DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00014

We introduce a computationally efficient approximation of vibrational entropy changes (ΔSvib) upon binding to biomolecules based on rigidity theory. From constraint network representations of the binding partners, ΔSvib is estimated from changes in the number of low frequency (“spongy”) modes with respect to changes in the networks’ coordination number. Compared to ΔSvibcomputed by normal-mode analysis (NMA), our approach yields significant and good to fair correlations for data sets of protein–protein and protein–ligand complexes. Our approach could be a valuable alternative to NMA-based ΔSvib computation in end-point (free) energy methods.","Special Pairs Are Decisive in the Autoionization and Recombination of Water
Chen Bai and Judith Herzfeld
The Journal of Physical Chemistry B Article ASAP
DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b02110
Although water’s chemical properties are no less important than its exceptional physical properties, its acid–base behavior is relatively poorly understood. In fact, the Grotthus trajectories for ion recombination predicted by density functional theory do not comport well with the almost 100-fold slower diffusive trajectories observed in time-resolved spectroscopy. And, in the reverse reaction, the barrier to autoionization is not well characterized. Here we develop a self-consistent picture of both processes based on the occurrence and role of ultrashort hydrogen bonds. The predicted populations of these special pairs in bulk water are consistent with the high frequency electrodynamics of water and its pressure dependence. The rate-limiting role of the special pairs manifests in autoionization as a two-stage barrier, first to form a contact ion pair and then to separate it by one water molecule. From this configuration, similar frequencies are observed for further separation vs recombination. The requirement of ultrashort hydrogen bonds for proton transfer in autoionization is consistent with the rise in Kw with increasing pressure and points to a role for density fluctuations in autoionization events. In neutralization, the manifestation of the role of special pairs is the prolonged diffusional process observed in time-resolved spectroscopy experiments. The requirement of special pairs as transition states for proton transfer is less obvious for neutralization in isolated water chains than in the bulk liquid only because an unbroken sequence of ultrashort H-bonds is more easily formed in a 1D H-bonded chain than in a 3D H-bonded network.
","Title: Buckling-induced F-actin fragmentation modulates the contraction of active cytoskeletal networks

Authors: Jing Li, Thomas Biel, Pranith Lomada, Qilin Yu and Taeyoon Kim

Abstract: Actomyosin contractility originating from interactions between F-actin and myosin facilitates various structural reorganizations of the actin cytoskeleton. Cross-linked actomyosin networks show a tendency to contract to single or multiple foci, which has been investigated extensively in numerous studies. Recently, it was suggested that suppression of F-actin buckling via an increase in bending rigidity significantly reduces network contraction. In this study, we demonstrate that networks may show the largest contraction at intermediate bending rigidity, not at the lowest rigidity, if filaments are severed by buckling arising from myosin activity as demonstrated in recent experiments; if filaments are very flexible, frequent severing events can severely deteriorate network connectivity, leading to the formation of multiple small foci and low network contraction. By contrast, if filaments are too stiff, the networks exhibit minimal contraction due to the inhibition of filament buckling. This study reveals that buckling-induced filament severing can modulate the contraction of active cytoskeletal networks, which has been neglected to date.

Abstract: N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are glycoproteins in the brain central to learning and memory. The e ects of glycosylation on the structure and dynamics of NMDARs are largely unknown. In this work, we use extensive molecular dynamics simulations of GluN1 and GluN2B ligand binding domains (LBDs) of NMDARs to investigate these e ects. Our simulations predict that intra-domain interactions involving the glycan attached to residue GluN1-N440 stabilize closed-clamshell conformations of the GluN1 LBD. The glycan on GluN2B-N688 shows a similar, though weaker, e ect. Based on these results, and assuming the transferability of the results of LBD simulations to the full receptor, we predict that glycans at GluN1-N440 might play a potentiator role in NMDARs. To validate this prediction, we perform electrophysiological analysis of full-length NMDARs with a glycosylation- preventing GluN1-N440Q mutation, and demonstrate an increase in the glycine EC50 value. Overall, our results suggest an intramolecular potentiating role of glycans on NMDA receptors.

An algorithm is proposed for the simulation of molecular systems with hybrid quantum chemical (QC) and molecular mechanical (MM) potentials that permits the adaptive partitioning of the atoms in the system between QC and MM regions. In contrast to existing methods, the algorithm requires only a single QC calculation of the QC/MM system per energy calculation and yet has consistent energy and forces, which makes it suitable for geometry optimizations and molecular dynamics calculations within the microcanonical ensemble, in addition to other types of simulation. This article describes the algorithm and its implementation, presents some simple test cases with both semiempirical and density functional theory QC/MM potentials, and discusses perspectives for future work.","J. Rydzewski, W.

Computational simulations in biophysics describe the dynamics and functions of biological macromolecules at the atomic level. Among motions particularly important for life are the transport processes in heterogeneous media. The process of ligand diffusion inside proteins is an example of a complex rare event that can be modeled using molecular dynamics simulations. The study of physical interactions between a ligand and its biological target is of paramount importance for the design of novel drugs and enzymes. Unfortunately, the process of ligand diffusion is difficult to study experimentally. The need for identifying the ligand egress pathways and understanding how ligands migrate through protein tunnels has spurred the development of several methodological approaches to this problem. The complex topology of protein channels and the transient nature of the ligand passage pose difficulties in the modeling of the ligand entry/escape pathways by canonical molecular dynamics simulations. In this review, we report a methodology involving a reconstruction of the ligand diffusion reaction coordinates and the free-energy profiles along these reaction coordinates using enhanced sampling of conformational space. We illustrate the above methods on several ligand–protein systems, including cytochromes and G-protein-coupled receptors. The methods are general and may be adopted to other transport processes in living matter.

Protonated water cluster is one of the most important hydrogen-bond network systems. Finding an appropriate DFT method to study the properties of protonated water clusters can substantially improve the economy in computational resources without sacrificing the accuracy compared to high-level methods. Using high-level MP2 and CCSD(T) methods as well as experimental results as benchmark, we systematically examined the effect of seven exchange-correlation GGA functionals (with BLYP, B3LYP, X3LYP, PBE0, PBE1W, M05-2X, and B97-D parametrizations) in describing the geometric parameters, interaction energies, dipole moments, and vibrational properties of protonated water clusters H+(H2O)2–9,12. The overall performance of all these functionals is acceptable, and each of them has its advantage in certain aspects. X3LYP is the best to describe the interaction energies, and PBE0 and M05-2X are also recommended to investigate interaction energies. PBE0 gives the best anharmonic frequencies, followed by PBE1W, B97-D and BLYP methods. PBE1W, B3LYP, B97-D, and X3LYP can yield better geometries. The capability of B97-D to distinguish the relative energies between isomers is the best among all the seven methods, followed by M05-2X and PBE0.","V Satarifard, S Kashefolgheta, AV Verde, and A Grafmüller, ""Is the
Solution Activity Derivative Sufficient to Parametrize Ion–Ion
Interactions? Ions for TIP5P Water"" J. Chem. Theory Comput. ASAP
Article 2017.

Biomolecular processes involve hydrated ions, and thus molecular
simulations of such processes require accurate force-field parameters
for these ions. In the best force-fields, both ion–water and
anion–cation interactions are explicitly parametrized. First, the ion
Lennard-Jones parameters are optimized to reproduce, for example,
single ion solvation free energies; then ion-pair interactions are
adjusted to match experimental activity or activity derivatives. Here,
we apply this approach to derive optimized parameters for concentrated
NaCl, KCl, MgCl2, and CaCl2 salt solutions, to be used with the TIP5P
water model. These parameters are of interest because of a number of
desirable properties of the TIP5P water model, especially for the
simulation of carbohydrates. The results show, that this state of the
art approach is insufficient, because the activity derivative often
reaches a plateau near the target experimental value, for a wide range
of parameter values. The plateau emerges from the interconversion
between different types of ion pairs, so parameters leading to equally
good agreement with the target solution activity or activity
derivative yield very different solution structures. To resolve this
indetermination, a second target property, such as the experimentally
determined ion–ion coordination number, is required to uniquely
determine anion–cation interactions. Simulations show that combining
activity derivatives and coordination number as experimental target
properties to parametrize ion–ion interactions, is a powerful method
for reliable ion–water force field parametrization, and gives insight
into the concentration of contact or solvent shared ion pairs in a
wide range of salt concentrations. For the alkali and halide ions Li+,
Rb+, Cs+, F–, Br–, and I–, we present ion–water parameters appropriate

Metadynamics is a powerful enhanced molecular dynamics sampling method that accelerates simulations by adding history-dependent multi-dimensional Gaussians along selective collective variables (CVs). In practice, choosing a small number of slow CVs remains challenging due to the inherent high dimensionality of biophysical systems. Here we show that time-structure based independent component analysis (tICA), a recent advance in Markov state model literature, can be used to identify a set of variationally optimal slow coordinates for use as CVs for Metadynamics. We show that linear and non-linear tICA-Metadynamics can complement existing MD studies by explicitly sampling the system’s slowest modes, and can even drive transitions along the slowest modes even when no such transitions are observed in unbiased simulations.","Communication: Slow proton-charge diffusion in nanoconfined water

The Journal of Chemical Physics 2017 146:13 
We investigate proton-charge mobility in nanoscopic water droplets with tuneable size. We find that the diffusion of confined proton charges causes a dielectric relaxation process with a maximum-loss frequency determined by the diffusion constant. In volumes less than ∼5 nm in diameter, proton-charge diffusion slows down significantly with decreasing size: for diameters <1<1 nm, the diffusion constant is about 100 times smaller than in bulk water. The low mobility probably results from the more rigid hydrogen-bond network of nanoconfined water, since proton-charge mobility in water relies on collective hydrogen-bond rearrangements.","Enhanced Conformational Sampling of N-Glycans in Solution with Replica State Exchange Metadynamics
Raimondas Galvelis, Suyong Re, and Yuji Sugita Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation Article ASAP DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00079

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of a N-glycan in solution is challenging because of high-energy barriers of the glycosidic linkages, functional group rotational barriers, and numerous intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds. In this study, we apply different enhanced conformational sampling approaches, namely, metadynamics (MTD), the replica-exchange MD (REMD), and the recently proposed replica state exchange MTD (RSE-MTD), to a N-glycan in solution and compare the conformational sampling efficiencies of the approaches. MTD helps to cross the high-energy barrier along the ω angle by utilizing a bias potential, but it cannot enhance sampling of the other degrees of freedom. REMD ensures moderate-energy barrier crossings by exchanging temperatures between replicas, while it hardly crosses the barriers along ω. In contrast, RSE-MTD succeeds to cross the high-energy barrier along ω as well as to enhance sampling of the other degrees of freedom. We tested two RSE-MTD schemes: in one scheme, 64 replicas were simulated with the bias potential along ω at different temperatures, while simulations of four replicas were performed with the bias potentials for different CVs at 300 K. In both schemes, one unbiased replica at 300 K was included to compute conformational properties of the glycan. The conformational sampling of the former is better than the other enhanced sampling methods, while the latter shows reasonable performance without spending large computational resources. The latter scheme is likely to be useful when a N-glycan-attached protein is simulated.","J Wang, MA Gayatri, and AL Ferguson, ""Mesoscale Simulation and

aggregation proceeds via a hierarchical self-assembly process that is

details of the emergent cluster morphologies and their relative
stability under different processing conditions remain poorly

of a prototypical asphaltene molecule to establish a phase diagram
mapping the self-assembled morphologies as a function of temperature,
pressure, and n-heptane:toluene solvent ratio informing how to control
asphaltene aggregation by regulating external processing conditions.
We then combine our simulations with graph matching and nonlinear
manifold learning to determine low-dimensional free energy surfaces
governing asphaltene self-assembly. In doing so, we introduce a
variant of diffusion maps designed to handle data sets with large
local density variations, and report the first application of
many-body diffusion maps to molecular self-assembly to recover a
pseudo-1D free energy landscape. Increasing pressure only weakly
affects the landscape, serving only to destabilize the largest
aggregates. Increasing temperature and toluene solvent fraction
stabilizes small cluster sizes and loose bonding arrangements.
Although the underlying molecular mechanisms differ, the strikingly
similar effect of these variables on the free energy landscape
suggests that toluene acts upon asphaltene self-assembly as an
effective temperature.",
"Inclusion of lipopeptides into the DMPC lipid bilayers prevents Aβ peptide insertion 
Parikh, Niyati and Klimov, Dmitri K Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2017, Advance Article  DOI:10.1039/C7CP01003F
Using an all-atom explicit water model and replica exchange with solute tempering molecular dynamics we have studied the binding of Aβ10–40 peptides to the mixed cationic bilayers composed of DMPC lipids and C14-KAAK lipopeptides (LPs). Using as a control our previous replica exchange simulations probing binding of the same peptide to the zwitterionic DMPC bilayer we assessed the impact of lipopeptides on the Aβ binding mechanism. We found that binding to the mixed DMPC + LP bilayers does not enhance the Aβ helix propensity as much as binding to the pure DMPC bilayers. Tertiary interactions also differ in the peptide bound to the DMPC + LP bilayers due to a reduced helix content, salt bridge disruption, and the formation of new long-range hydrophobic interactions. More importantly, we showed that mixing lipopeptides into the DMPC bilayers prevents Aβ10–40 insertion forcing the peptide to reside on the bilayer surface and considerably destabilizes Aβ–bilayer interactions leading to the formation of a shallow water layer between the peptide and the bilayer. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Aβ10–40 peptides cause minor DMPC + LP bilayer thinning and perturbation beneath their binding footprint. These observations stand in sharp contrast to Aβ10–40 binding to the pure DMPC bilayers, which results in deep peptide insertion and significant disruption of the bilayer structure. We argued that lipopeptides expel Aβ10–40 peptides from the bilayer due to strong, mostly electrostatic, interfacial interactions introduced by the lipopeptides into the bilayers. We therefore propose that C14-KAAK lipopeptides can be used to engineer lipid bilayers, which withstand binding of Alzheimer's Aβ peptides.","J. M. Troiano, A. C. McGeachy, L. K. Olenick, D. Fang, D.

Abstract:

Mechanistic insight into how polycations disrupt and cross cell membranes is needed for understanding and controlling polycation–membrane interactions, yet such information is surprisingly difficult to obtain at the molecular level. We use second harmonic and vibrational sum frequency generation spectroscopies along with quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring and computer simulations to quantify the interaction of poly(allylamine) hydrochloride (PAH) and its monomeric precursor allylamine hydrochloride (AH) with lipid bilayers. We find PAH adsorption to be reversible and nondisruptive to the bilayer under the conditions of our experiments. With an observed free adsorption energy of −52.7 ± 0.6 kJ/mol, PAH adsorption was found to be surprisingly less favorable relative to AH (−14.6 ± 0.4 kJ/mol) when considering a simple additive model. By experimentally quantifying the number of adsorbates and the average amount of charge carried by each adsorbate, we find that the PAH is associated with only 70% of the positive charges it could hold while the AH remains mostly charged while attached to the membrane. Simulations indicate that PAH pulls in condensed counterions from solution to avoid charge-repulsion along its backbone and with other PAH molecules to attach to, and completely cover, the bilayer surface. In addition, computations indicate that the amine groups shift their pKa values due to the confined environment upon adsorption to the surface. Our results provide experimental constraints for theoretical calculations, which yield atomistic views of the structures that are formed when polycations interact with lipid membranes that will be important for predicting polycation-membrane interactions.","Accuracy Test of the OPLS-AA Force Field for Calculating Free Energies of Mixing and Comparison with PAC-MAC

We have calculated the excess free energy of mixing of 1053 binary mixtures with the OPLS-AA force field using two different methods: thermodynamic integration (TI) of molecular dynamics simulations and the Pair Configuration to Molecular Activity Coefficient (PAC-MAC) method. PAC-MAC is a force field based quasi-chemical method for predicting miscibility properties of various binary mixtures. The TI calculations yield a root mean squared error (RMSE) compared to experimental data of 0.132 kBT (0.37 kJ/mol). PAC-MAC shows a RMSE of 0.151 kBT with a calculation speed being potentially 1.0·10^4 times greater than TI. OPLS-AA force field parameters are optimized using PAC-MAC based on vapor-liquid equilibrium data, instead of enthalpies of vaporization or densities. The RMSE of PAC-MAC is reduced to 0.099 kBT by optimizing 50 force field parameters. The resulting OPLS-PM force field has a comparable accuracy as the OPLS-AA force field in the calculation of mixing free energies using TI.","E Wang, JB Klauda, ""Examination of Mixtures Containing

Relaxation times also indicate cholesterol dependence and show a
strong preference for rotational axial motion over wobbling motion.
Radial distribution functions and lipid clustering indicate strong
relationships between lateral ordering and hydrogen bonding, which is

self-association of cholesterol at high concentrations, causing
shielding from further SM–cholesterol interactions. The importance of

abstract: Integral membrane protein function can be modulated by the host bilayer. Because biological membranes are diverse and nonuniform, we explore the consequences of lipid diversity using gramicidin A channels embedded in phosphatidylcholine (PC) bilayers composed of equimolar mixtures of di-oleoyl-PC and di-erucoyl-PC (dC18:1+dC22:1, respectively), di-palmitoleoyl-PC and di-nervonoyl-PC (dC16:1+dC24:1, respectively), and di-eicosenoyl-PC (pure dC20:1), all of which have the same average bilayer chain length. Single-channel lifetime experiments, molecular dynamics simulations, and a simple lipid compression model are used in tandem to gain insight into lipid redistribution around the channel, which partially alleviates the bilayer deformation energy associated with channel formation. The average single-channel lifetimes in the two-component bilayers (95 ± 10 ms for dC18:1+dC22:1 and 195 ± 20 ms for dC16:1+dC24:1) were increased relative to the single-component dC20:1 control bilayer (65 ± 10 ms), implying lipid redistribution. Using a theoretical treatment of thickness-dependent changes in channel lifetimes, the effective local enrichment of lipids around the channel was estimated to be 58 ± 4% dC18:1 and 66 ± 2% dC16:1 in the dC18:1+dC22:1 and dC16:1+dC24:1 bilayers, respectively. 3.5-μs molecular dynamics simulations show 66 ± 2% dC16:1 in the first lipid shell around the channel in the dC16:1+dC24:1 bilayer, but no significant redistribution (50 ± 4% dC18:1) in the dC18:1+dC22:1 bilayer; these simulated values are within the 95% confidence intervals of the experimental averages. The strong preference for the better matching lipid (dC16:1) near the channel in the dC16:1+dC24:1 mixture and lesser redistribution in the dC18:1+dC22:1 mixture can be explained by the energetic cost associated with compressing the lipids to match the channel’s hydrophobic length.","Q.

Abstract: The ability of a feed-forward neural network to learn and classify different states of polymer configurations is systematically explored. Performing numerical experiments, we find that a simple network model can, after adequate training, recognize multiple structures, including gaslike coil, liquidlike globular, and crystalline anti-Mackay and Mackay structures. The network can be trained to identify the transition points between various states, which compare well with those identified by independent specific-heat calculations.

Here, we report the molecular dynamics simulations of EDLs near rigid polyanion nanorods immersed in electrolytes containing ionic liquids [C2mim][TfO], water, and Na+ ions. When the water content in bulk electrolyte is high, the EDLs near the rods are similar to those in aqueous electrolytes except that TfO– ions accumulate notably near the cation layer adsorbed on the rods. When the water content in the bulk electrolyte becomes very low, even though water is greatly enriched in the interfacial region, the microenvironment in the region offers weak dielectric screening and the EDL exhibits features common to those in neat ionic liquids, e.g., charge overscreening. Na+ ions are readily adsorbed on the sulfonate groups of the polyanion rod in the range of water contents explored here but can experience an energy barrier when moving from the bulk electrolyte to the rod surface if the water content is very low. Introducing Na+ ions into the system displaces C2mim+ ions from the rod’s surface. However, the number of displaced C2mim+ions is far less than the Na+ newly adsorbed on the rod, and thus, charge overscreening is enhanced. We highlight the important role of ion–ion correlations in determining the EDL characteristics and their response to the variation of mixture electrolytes’ water/Na+ ion contents revealed here and discuss their technical implications.","H Sha and F Zhu, ""Parameter Optimization for Interaction between
C-Terminal Domains of HIV-1 Capsid Protein"" J. Chem. Inf. Model. ASAP
Article 2017.

HIV-1 capsid proteins (CAs) assemble into a capsid that encloses the
viral RNA. The binding between a pair of C-terminal domains (CTDs)
constitutes a major interface in both the CA dimers and the large CA
assemblies. Here, we attempt to use a general residue-level
coarse-grained model to describe the interaction between two isolated
CTDs in Monte Carlo simulations. With the standard parameters that
depend only on the residue types, the model predicts a much weaker
binding in comparison to the experiments. Detailed analysis reveals
that some Lennard-Jones parameters are not compatible with the
experimental CTD dimer structure, thus resulting in an unfavorable
interaction energy. To improve the model for the CTD binding, we
introduce ad hoc modifications to a small number of Lennard-Jones
parameters for some specific pairs of residues at the binding
interface. Through a series of extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we
identify the optimal parameters for the CTD–CTD interactions. With the
refined model parameters, both the binding affinity (with a
dissociation constant of 13 ± 2 μM) and the binding mode are in good
agreement with the experimental data. This study demonstrates that the
general interaction model based on the Lennard-Jones potential, with
some modest adjustment of the parameters for key residues, could
correctly reproduce the reversible protein binding, thus potentially
applicable for simulating the thermodynamics of the CA assemblies.",

journal: Biophysical Journal Volume 112, Issue 6, Pages 1198–1213

abstract: To change conformation, a protein must deform the surrounding bilayer. In this work, a three-dimensional continuum elastic model for gramicidin A in a lipid bilayer is shown to describe the sensitivity to thickness, curvature stress, and the mechanical properties of the lipid bilayer. A method is demonstrated to extract the gramicidin-lipid boundary condition from all-atom simulations that can be used in the three-dimensional continuum model. The boundary condition affects the deformation dramatically, potentially much more than typical variations in the material stiffness do as lipid composition is changed. Moreover, it directly controls the sensitivity to curvature stress. The curvature stress and hydrophobic surfaces of the all-atom and continuum models are found to be in excellent agreement. The continuum model is applied to estimate the enrichment of hydrophobically matched lipids near the channel in a mixture, and the results agree with single-channel experiments and extended molecular dynamics simulations from the companion article by Beaven et al. in this issue of Biophysical Journal.","J.

Theory Comput., Just Accepted, DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.6b01160

Abstract:

We develop an extended ensemble method for constructing transferable, low-resolution coarse-grained (CG) models of polyethylene-oxide (PEO)-based ionomer chains with varying composition at multiple temperatures. In particular, we consider ionomer chains consisting of 4 isophthalate groups, which may be neutral or sulfonated, that are linked by 13 PEO repeat units. The CG models represent each isophthalate group with a single CG site and also explicitly represent the diffusing sodium counterions, but do not explicitly represent the PEO backbone. We define the extended ensemble as a collection of equilibrium ensembles that are obtained from united atom (UA) simulations at 2 different temperatures for 7 chemically distinct ionomers with varying degrees of sulfonation. We employ a global force-matching method to determine the set of interaction potentials that, when appropriately combined, provide an optimal ap- proximation to the many-body potential of mean force for each system in the extended ensemble. This optimized xn force field employs long-ranged Coulomb potentials with system-specific dielectric constants that systematically decrease with increasing sulfonation and temperature. An empirical exponential model reasonably describes the sensitivity of the dielectric to sulfonation, but we find it more challenging to model the temperature-dependence of the dielectrics. Nevertheless, given appropriate dielectric constants, the transferable xn force field reasonably describes the ion pairing that is observed in the UA simulations as a function of sulfonation and temperature. Remarkably, despite eliminating any explicit description of the PEO backbone, the CG model predicts string-like ion aggregates that appear qualitatively consistent with the ionomer peak observed in X-ray scattering experiments and, moreover, with the temperature dependence of this peak.","Predicting reaction coordinates in energy landscapes with diffusion anisotropy

arXiv:1704.03912v1

We consider a range of model potentials with metastable states undergoing molecular dynamics coupled to a thermal bath in the high friction regime, and consider how the optimal reaction coordinate depends on the diffusion anisotropy. For this we use our recently proposed method “Spectral gap optimization of order parameters (SGOOP)” (Tiwary and Berne, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 113 2839 2016). We show how available information about dynamical observables in addition to static information can be incorporated into SGOOP, which can then be used to accurately determine the “best” reaction coordinate for arbitrary anisotropies. We compare our results with transmission coefficient calculations and published benchmarks where applicable or available respectively.","Poursoroush, Asma, Maria Maddalena Sperotto, and Mohamed Laradji. ""Phase behavior of supported lipid bilayers: A systematic study by coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations."" The Journal of Chemical Physics 146, no. 15 (2017): 154902.

Solid-supported lipid bilayers are utilized by experimental scientists as models for biological membranes because of their stability. However, compared to free standing bilayers, their close proximity to the substrate may affect their phase behavior. As this is still poorly understood, and few computational studies have been performed on such systems thus far, here we present the results from a systematic study based on molecular dynamics simulations of an implicit-solvent model for solid-supported lipid bilayers with varying lipid-substrate interactions. The attractive interaction between the substrate and the lipid head groups that are closest to the substrate leads to an increased translocation of the lipids from the distal to the proximal bilayer-leaflet. This thereby leads to a transbilayer imbalance of the lipid density, with the lipid density of the proximal leaflet higher than that of the distal leaflet. Consequently, the order parameter of the proximal leaflet is found to be higher than that of the distal leaflet, the higher the strength of lipid interaction is, the stronger the effect. The proximal leaflet exhibits gel and fluid phases with an abrupt melting transition between the two phases. In contrast, below the melting temperature of the proximal leaflet, the distal leaflet is inhomogeneous with coexisting gel and fluid domains. The size of the fluid domains increases with increasing the strength of the lipid interaction. At low temperatures, the inhomogeneity of the distal leaflet is due to its reduced lipid density.",

abstract: Reducing the number of degrees of freedom in molecular models—so-called coarse-graining—is a popular approach to increase the accessible time scales and system sizes in molecular dynamics simulations. It involves, however, per se a loss of information. In order to retain a high accuracy in the region of interest, hybrid methods that combine two levels of resolution in a single system are an attractive trade-off. Hybrid atomistic (AT)/coarse-grained (CG) simulations have previously been shown to preserve the secondary structure elements of AT proteins in CG water but to cause an artificial increase in intramolecular hydrogen bonds, resulting in a reduced flexibility of the proteins. Recently, it was found that the AT-CG interactions employed in these simulations were too favourable for apolar solutes and not favourable enough for polar solutes. Here, the AT-CG interactions are reparametrised to reproduce the solvation free energy of a series of AT alkanes and side-chain analogues in CG water, while retaining the good mixing behaviour of AT water with CG water. The new AT-CG parameters are tested in hybrid simulations of four proteins in CG water. Structural and dynamic properties are compared to those obtained in fully AT simulations and, if applicable, to experimental data. The results show that the artificial increase of intramolecular hydrogen bonds is drastically reduced, leading to a better reproduction of the structural properties and flexibility of the proteins in atomistic water, without the need for an atomistic solvent layer.","N.

Abstract: 

The accurate identification of the specific points of interaction between G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) oligomers is essential for the design of receptor ligands targeting oligomeric receptor targets. A coarse-grained molecular dynamics computer simulation approach would provide a compelling means of identifying these specific protein-protein interactions and could be applied both for known oligomers of interest and as a high-throughput screen to identify novel oligomeric targets. However, to be effective, this in silico modeling must provide accurate, precise, and reproducible information. This has been achieved recently in numerous biological systems using an ensemble-based all-atom molecular dynamics approach. In this study, we describe an equivalent methodology for ensemble-based coarse-grained simulations. We report the performance of this method when applied to four different GPCRs known to oligomerize, using error analysis to determine the ensemble size and individual replica simulation time required. Our measurements of distance between residues shown to be involved in oligomerization of the fifth transmembrane domain from the adenosine A2A receptor are in very good agreement with the existing biophysical data and provide information about the nature of the contact interface that cannot be determined experimentally. Calculations of distance between rhodopsin, CXCR4 and β1AR transmembrane domains reported to form contact points in homodimers correlate well with the corresponding measurements obtained from the structural data, providing an ability to predict contact interfaces computationally. Interestingly, error analysis enables identification of non-interacting regions. Our results confirm that GPCR interactions can be reliably predicted using this novel methodology.","What Can and Cannot Be Learned from Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Bacterial Proton-Coupled Oligopeptide Transporter GkPOT?

We have performed an extensive set of all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a bacterial proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter (POT) in an explicit membrane environment. We have characterized both the local and global conformational dynamics of the transporter upon the proton and/or substrate binding, within a statistical framework. Our results reveal a clearly distinct behavior for local conformational dynamics in the absence and presence of the proton at the putative proton binding residue E310. Particularly, we find that the substrate binding conformation is drastically different in the two conditions, where the substrate binds to the protein in a lateral/vertical manner, in the presence/absence of the proton. We do not observe any statistically significant distinctive behavior in terms of the global conformational changes in different simulation conditions, within the time scales of our simulations. Our extensive simulations and analyses call into question the implicit assumption of many MD studies that local conformational changes observed in short simulations could provide clues to the global conformational changes that occur on much longer time scales. The linear regression analysis of quantities associated with the global conformational fluctuations, however, provides an indication of a mechanism involving the concerted motion of the transmembrane helices, consistent with the rocker-switch mechanism.","Sha, Hao, and Fangqiang Zhu.

abstract: We present a systematic coarse-graining (CG) strategy for many particle molecular systems based on cluster expansion techniques. We construct a hierarchy of coarse-grained Hamiltonians with interaction potentials consisting of two, three and higher body interactions. The accuracy of the derived cluster expansion based on interatomic potentials is examined over a range of various temperatures and densities and compared to direct computation of pair potential of mean force. The comparison of the coarse-grained simulations is done on the basis of the structural properties, against the detailed all-atom data. We give specific examples for methane and ethane molecules in which the coarse-grained variable is the center of mass of the molecule. We investigate different temperature and density regimes, and we examine differences between the methane and ethane systems. Results show that the cluster expansion formalism can be used in order to provide accurate effective pair and three-body CG potentials at high T and low ρ regimes. In the liquid regime the three-body effective CG potentials give a small improvement, over the typical pair CG ones; however in order to get significantly better results one needs to consider even higher order terms.",,"Methodology for the Simulation of Molecular Motors at Different Scales

Millisecond-scale conformational transitions represent a seminal challenge for traditional molecular dynamics simulations, even with the help of high-end supercomputer architectures. Such events are particularly relevant to the study of molecular motors—proteins or abiological constructs that convert chemical energy into mechanical work. Here, we present a hybrid-simulation scheme combining an array of methods including elastic network models, transition path sampling, and advanced free-energy methods, possibly in conjunction with generalized-ensemble schemes to deliver a viable option for capturing the millisecond-scale motor steps of biological motors. The methodology is already implemented in large measure in popular molecular dynamics programs, and it can leverage the massively parallel capabilities of petascale computers. The applicability of the hybrid method is demonstrated with two examples, namely cyclodextrin-based motors and V-type ATPases.","Chen, Jin, Qian Zhang, Weitong Ren, and Wenfei Li.

Despite considerable effort, elucidating allostery of large macromolecular assemblies at a molecular level in solution remains technically challenging due to its structural complexity. Here we have employed an approach combining amide backbone hydrogen/deuterium exchange coupled with mass spectrometry, fluorescence spectroscopy and molecular simulations to characterize allosteric patterns of chaperonin GroEL, a ~800 kDa tetradecamer from E. coli. Using available crystal structures of GroEL, we quantitatively map out GroEL allosteric changes in solution by resolving exchange behaviors of 133 overlapping proteolytic peptides with more than 95% sequence coverage. This comprehensive analysis gives a refined resolution down to 5 residues to pilot the GroEL allosteric determinants, of which the localized dynamics is monitored by tryptophan-mutated GroEL. Furthermore, the GroEL conformational transition is evaluated by molecular dynamics simulations with an atomic-interaction-based coarse-grained model. Collectively, we provide a practical methodology to analyze GroEL allostery in solution.",

Abstract Metadynamics is a powerful enhanced molecular dynamics sampling method that accelerates simulations by adding history-dependent multi-dimensional Gaussians along selective collective variables (CVs). In practice, choosing a small number of slow CVs remains challenging due to the inherent high dimensionality of biophysical systems. Here we show that time-structure based independent component analysis (tICA), a recent advance in Markov state model literature, can be used to identify a set of variationally optimal slow coordinates for use as CVs for Metadynamics. We show that linear and non-linear tICA-Metadynamics can complement existing MD studies by explicitly sampling the system’s slowest modes, and can even drive transitions along the slowest modes even when no such transitions are observed in unbiased simulations.",,"Title: Accelerating physical simulations of proteins by leveraging external knowledge

Abstract It is challenging to compute structure-function relationships of proteins using molecular physics. The problem arises from the exponential scaling of the computational searching and sampling of large conformational spaces. This scaling challenge is not met by today's methods, such as Monte Carlo, simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, or molecular dynamics (MD) or its variants such as replica exchange. Such methods of searching for optimal states on complex probabilistic landscapes are referred to more broadly as Explore-and-Exploit (EE), including in contexts such as computational learning, games, industrial planning, and modeling military strategies. Here, we describe a Bayesian method, called MELD, that ‘melds’ together EE approaches with externally added information that can be vague, combinatoric, noisy, intuitive, heuristic, or from experimental data. MELD is shown to accelerate physical MD simulations when using experimental data to determine protein structures; for predicting protein structures by using heuristic directives; and when predicting binding affinities of proteins from limited information about the binding site. Such Guided EE approaches might also be useful beyond proteins and beyond molecular science.",,

DOI: 10.1101/123752

Abstract Molecular dynamics simulations of biomolecules produce a very high dimensional time-series dataset. Performing analysis necessarily involves projection onto a lower dimensional space. A priori selection of projection coordinates requires (perhaps unavailable) prior information or intuition about the system. At best, such a projection can only confirm the intuition. At worst, a poor projection can obscure new features of the system absent from the intuition. Previous statistical methods such a time-structure based independent component analysis (tICA) and Markov state modeling (MSMs) have offered relatively unbiased means of projecting conformations onto coordinates or state labels, respectively. These analyses are underpinned by the propagator formalism and the assumption that slow dynamics are biologically interesting. Although arising from the same mathematics, tICA and MSMs have different strengths and weaknesses. We introduce a unifying method which we term “landmark kernel tICA” (lktICA) which uses a variant of the Nyström kernel approximation to permit approximate non-linear solutions to the tICA problem. We show that lktICA is equivalent to MSMs with “soft” states. We demonstrate the advantages of this united method by finding improved projections of (a) a 1D potential surface (b) a peptide folding trajectory and (c) an ion channel conformational change.",,"Title: Mesoscale Simulation and Machine Learning of Asphaltene Aggregation Phase Behavior and Molecular Assembly Landscapes

Abstract Asphaltenes constitute the heaviest fraction of the aromatic group in crude oil. Aggregation and precipitation of asphaltenes during petroleum processing costs the petroleum industry billions of dollars each year due to downtime and production inefficiencies. Asphaltene aggregation proceeds via a hierarchical self-assembly process that is welldescribed by the Yen-Mullins model. Nevertheless, the microscopic details of the emergent cluster morphologies and their relative stability under different processing conditions remain poorly understood. We perform coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of a prototypical asphaltene molecule to establish a phase diagram mapping the self-assembled morphologies as a function of temperature, pressure, and nheptane:toluene solvent ratio informing how to control asphaltene aggregation by regulating external processing conditions. We then combine our simulations with graph matching and nonlinear manifold learning to determine low-dimensional free energy surfaces governing asphaltene self-assembly. In doing so we introduce a variant of diffusion maps designed to handle data sets with large local density variations, and report the first application of many-body diffusion maps to molecular self-assembly to recover a pseudo-1D free energy landscape. Increasing pressure only weakly affects the landscape, serving only to destabilize the largest aggregates. Increasing temperature and toluene solvent fraction stabilizes small cluster sizes and loose bonding arrangements. Although the underlying molecular mechanisms differ, the strikingly similar effect of these variables on the free energy landscape suggests that toluene acts upon asphaltene self-assembly as an effective temperature.",,

Abstract While the use of machine-learning (ML) techniques is well established in cheminformatics for the prediction of physicochemical properties and binding affinities, the training of ML models based on data from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a fingerprint termed MDFP which is constructed from the distributions of properties such as potential-energy components, radius of gyration and solvent-accessible surface area extracted from MD simulations. The corresponding fingerprint elements are the first two statistical moments of the distributions and the median. By considering not only the average but also the spread of the distribution in the fingerprint, some degree of entropic information is encoded. Short MD simulations of the molecules in water (and in vacuum) are used to generate the MDFP. These are further combined with simple counts based on the 2D structure of the molecules into MDFP+. The resulting information-rich MDFP+ are used to train ML models for the prediction of solvation free energies in five different solvents (water, octanol, chloroform, hexadecane and cyclohexane) as well as partition coefficients in octanol/water, hexadecane/water and cyclohexane/water. The approach is easy to implement and computationally relatively inexpensive. Yet, it performs similarly well compared to more rigorous MD-based free-energy methods such as free-energy pertur- bation (FEP) as well as end-state methods such as linear interaction energy (LIE), the conductor-like screening model for realistic solvation (COSMO-RS) and the SMx family of solvation models.",,"Title: Rich Dynamics Underlying Solution Reactions Revealed by Sampling and Data Mining of Reactive Trajectories

Abstract Efficient sampling in both configuration and trajectory spaces, combined with mechanism analyses via data mining, allows a systematic investigation of the thermodynamics, kinetics, and molecular-detailed dynamics of chemical reactions in solution. Through a Bayesian learning algorithm, the reaction coordinate(s) of a (retro-)Claisen rearrangement in bulk water was variationally optimized. The bond formation/breakage was found to couple with intramolecular charge separation and dipole change, and significant dynamic solvent effects manifest, leading to the “in-water” acceleration of Claisen rearrangement. In addition, the vibrational modes of the reactant and the solvation states are significantly coupled to the reaction dynamics, leading to heterogeneous and oscillatory reaction paths. The calculated reaction rate is well interpreted by the Kramers’ theory with a diffusion term accounting for solvent–solute interactions. These findings demonstrated that the reaction mechanisms can be complicated in homogeneous solutions since the solvent–solute interactions can profoundly influence the reaction dynamics and the energy transfer process.",,

Abstract Amphiphile self-assembly is an essential bottom-up approach of fabricating advanced functional materials. Self-assembled materials with desired structures are often obtained through thermodynamic control. Here, we demonstrate that the selection of kinetic pathways can lead to drastically different self-assembled structures, underlining the significance of kinetic control in self-assembly. By constructing kinetic network models from large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, we show that two largely similar amphiphiles, 1-[11-oxo-11-(pyren-1-ylmethoxy)-undecyl]pyridinium bromide (PYR) and 1-(11-((5a1,8a-dihydropyren-1-yl)methylamino)-11-oxoundecyl)pyridinium bromide (PYN), prefer distinct kinetic assembly pathways. While PYR prefers an incremental growth mechanism and forms a nanotube, PYN favors a hopping growth pathway leading to a vesicle. Such preference was found to originate from the subtle difference in the distributions of hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups in their chemical structures, which leads to different rates of the adhesion process among the aggregating micelles. Our results are in good agreement with experimental results, and accentuate the role of kinetics in the rational design of amphiphile self-assembly.",,"Title: Prediction of Organic Reaction Outcomes Using Machine Learning

Abstract Computer assistance in synthesis design has existed for over 40 years, yet retrosynthesis planning software has struggled to achieve widespread adoption. One critical challenge in developing high-quality pathway suggestions is that proposed reaction steps often fail when attempted in the laboratory, despite initially seeming viable. The true measure of success for any synthesis program is whether the predicted outcome matches what is observed experimentally. We report a model framework for anticipating reaction outcomes that combines the traditional use of reaction templates with the flexibility in pattern recognition afforded by neural networks. Using 15 000 experimental reaction records from granted United States patents, a model is trained to select the major (recorded) product by ranking a self-generated list of candidates where one candidate is known to be the major product. Candidate reactions are represented using a unique edit-based representation that emphasizes the fundamental transformation from reactants to products, rather than the constituent molecules’ overall structures. In a 5-fold cross-validation, the trained model assigns the major product rank 1 in 71.8% of cases, rank ≤3 in 86.7% of cases, and rank ≤5 in 90.8% of cases. ",,

Abstract Ras superfamily of GTPases regulate myriad cellular processes through a conserved nucleotide (GTP/GDP) dependent switching mechanism. Unlike Ras family of GTPases, for the Rho GTPases, there is no clear evidence for the existence of “sub-states” such as state 1 & state 2 in the GTP bound form. To explore the nucleotide dependent conformational space of the Switch I loop and also to look for existence of state 1 like conformations in Rho GTPases, atomistic molecular dynamics and metadynamics simulations on RhoA were performed. These studies demonstrate that both the nucleotide-free state and the GDP bound “OFF” state have very similar conformations, whereas the GTP bound “ON” state has unique conformations with signatures of two intermediate states. The conformational free energy landscape for these systems suggests the presence of multiple intermediate states. Interestingly, the energetic penalty of exposing the non-polar residues in the GTP bound form is counter balanced by the favourable hydrogen bonded interactions between the γ-phosphate group of GTP with the highly conserved Tyr34 and Thr37 residues. These competing molecular interactions lead to a tuneable energy landscape of the Switch I conformation, which can undergo significant changes based on the local environment including changes upon binding to effectors.",,"Title: Overcoming the limitations of the MARTINI force field in Molecular Dynamics simulations of polysaccharides

Abstract Polysaccharides (carbohydrates) are key regulators of a large number of cell biological processes. However, precise biochemical or genetic manipulation of these often complex structures is laborious and hampers experimental structure-function studies. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations provide a valuable alternative tool to generate and test hypotheses on saccharide function. Yet, most currently used MD force fields overstate non-bonded interactions between polysaccharide molecules, strongly limiting the usability of those simulations. Here we tested MARTINI, a popular coarsegrained (CG) force field for biological macromolecules, for its ability to accurately represent molecular forces between saccharides. To this end, we calculated a thermodynamic solution property, the second virial coefficient of the osmotic pressure (B22). Comparison with light scattering experiments revealed that MARTINI strongly overestimates non-bonded interactions for a prototypic polysaccharide, leading to unrealistic aggregation. This finding also applies to smaller oligosaccharides which were all found to aggregate in simulations even at moderate concentrations, well below their solubility limit.

Abstract Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations offer the possibility to study biological processes at high spatial and temporal resolution often not reachable by experiments. Corresponding biomolecular force field parameters have been developed for a wide variety of molecules ranging from inorganic ligands and small organic molecules over proteins and lipids to nucleic acids. Force fields have typically been parameterized and validated on thermodynamic observables and structural characteristics of individual compounds, e.g. of soluble proteins or lipid bilayers. Less strictly, due to the added complexity and missing experimental data to compare to, force fields have hardly been tested on the properties of mixed systems, e.g. on protein-lipid systems. Their selection and combination for mixed system is further complicated by the partially differing parameterization strategies. Additionally, the presence of other compounds in the system may shift the subtle balance of force field parameters.

Four observables were compared, focusing on the membrane-water interface: the conservation of the secondary structure of transmembrane proteins, the positioning of a transmembrane peptide relative to the lipid bilayer, the insertion depths of side chains of unfolded peptides absorbed at the membrane interface, and the ability to reproduce experimental insertion energies of Wimley-White peptides at the membrane interface. Significant differences between the force fields were observed that affect e.g. membrane insertion depth and tilting of transmembrane peptides.

Abstract We introduce a novel method, Pathway Search guided by Internal Motions (PSIM), that efficiently finds molecular dissociation pathways of a ligand–receptor system with guidance from principal component (PC) modes obtained from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Modeling ligand–receptor dissociation pathways can provide insights into molecular recognition and has practical applications, including understanding kinetic mechanisms and barriers to binding/unbinding as well as design of drugs with desired kinetic properties. PSIM uses PC modes in multi-level internal coordinates to identify natural molecular motions that guide the search for conformational switches and unbinding pathways. The new multi-level internal coordinates overcome problems with Cartesian and classical internal coordinates that fail to smoothly present dihedral rotation or generate non-physical distortions. We used HIV-1 protease, which has large-scale flap motions, as an example protein to demonstrate use of the multi-level internal coordinates. We provide examples of algorithms and implementation of PSIM with alanine dipeptide and chemical host–guest systems, 2-naphthylethanol–β-cyclodextrin and tetramethylammonium–cryptophane complexes. Tetramethylammonium–cryptophane has slow binding/unbinding kinetics. Its residence time, the length to dissociate tetramethylammonium from the host, is ~14 s from experiments, and PSIM revealed 4 dissociation pathways in approximately 150 CPU hr. We also searched the releasing pathways for the product glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate from tryptophan synthase, and one complete dissociation pathway was constructed after running multiple search iterations in approximately 300 CPU hr. With guidance by internal PC modes from MD simulations, the PSIM method has advantages over simulation-based methods to search for dissociation pathways of molecular systems with slow non-covalent kinetic behavior.",,

Abstract We consider a range of model potentials with metastable states undergoing molecular dynamics coupled to a thermal bath in the high friction regime, and consider how the optimal reaction coordinate depends on the diffusion anisotropy.

"Cheap but accurate calculation of chemical reaction rate constants from ab initio data, via system-specific, black-box force fields

Building on the recently published quantum-mechanically derived force field (QMDFF) and its empirical valence bondextension, EVB-QMDFF, it is now possible to generate a reliable potential energy surface for any given elementary reaction step in an essentially black box manner. This requires a limited and pre-defined set of reference data near the reaction path and generates an accurate approximation of the reference potential energy surface, on and off the reactionpath. This intermediate representation can be used to generate reaction rate data, with far better accuracy and reliability than with traditional approaches based on transition state theory (TST) or variational extensions thereof (VTST), even if those include sophisticated tunnelingcorrections. However, the additional expense at the reference level remains very modest. We demonstrate all this for three arbitrarily chosen example reactions.",,"Coimbra, J. T. S.; Fernandes, P. A.; Ramos, M.

We provide a proof of concept of the benefits of potential-energy modification methods, in particular the flooding technique, to enhance the sampling and improve the convergence of the potential-of-mean force. In addition, we also discuss how these potential modifiers could introduce the necessary bias to induce the correct description of other relevant internal degrees of freedom for the compounds, thus providing a more accurate description of the permeation process. Effective methodological approximations are taken into consideration, more specifically the inclusion of atomic polarization, and experimental data are used in the validation of computed values whenever possible.

,,"Hub, J. S.; Awasthi, N. Probing a Continuous Polar Defect: A Reaction Coordinate for Pore Formation in Lipid Membranes. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2017. ASAP

Various biophysical processes involve the formation of aqueous pores over lipid membranes, including processes of membrane fusion, antimicrobial peptide activity, lipid flip-flop, and membrane permeation. Reliable and efficient free-energy calculations of pore formation using molecular dynamics simulations remained challenging due to the lack of good reaction coordinates (RCs) for pore formation. We present a new RC for pore formation that probes the formation and rupture of a continuous polar defect over the membrane. Potential of mean force (PMF) calculations along the new RC rapidly converge and exhibit no hysteresis between pore-opening and pore-closing pathways, in contrast to calculations based on previous RCs. We show that restraints along the new RC may restrain the system tightly to the transition state of pore formation, rationalizing the absence of hysteresis. We observe that the PMF of pore formation in a tension-free membrane of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) reveals a free-energy barrier for pore nucleation, confirming a long-hypothesized metastable prepore state. We test the influence of the lipid force field, the cutoff distance used for Lennard-Jones interactions, and the lateral membrane size on the free energies of pore formation. In contrast to PMF calculations based on previous RCs, we find that such parameters have a relatively small influence on the free energies of pore nucleation. However, the metastability of the open pore in DMPC may depend on such parameters. The RC has been implemented into an extension of the GROMACS simulation software. The new RC allows for reliable and computationally efficient free-energy calculations of pore formation in lipid membranes.",,

The all-atom CHARMM36 (C36) force field is used to simulate bilayers of pure palmitoylsphingomyelin (PSM) as well as binary mixtures of PSM and stearoylsphingomyelin (SSM) at various cholesterol concentrations (XC) and temperatures. C36 simulation data is in good agreement with experimental deuterium order parameters and previous computational results, providing evidence of the utility of the force field for potentially studying more complex membranes. The area compressibility modulus is shown to achieve a large value of 2.82±0.08 N/m in cholesterol-rich membranes (XC=0.50). Surface area per lipid (SA/lip), tilt angle, membrane thicknesses, and acyl chain ordering are shown to have strong dependencies on cholesterol concentration. Relaxation times also indicate cholesterol dependence and show a strong preference for rotational axial motion over wobbling motion. Radial distribution functions and lipid clustering indicate strong relationships between lateral ordering and hydrogen bonding, which is long-lived in SM membranes. These interactions lead to strong self-association of cholesterol at high concentrations, causing shielding from further SM-cholesterol interactions. The importance of a ternary component on SM-SM hydrogen bonds is revealed in light of previous results and is consequential in the modelling of lipid rafts.",,

Intrinsic fluctuations of a protein enable it to sample a large

ligands. The role of ligand might be simply to alter the equilibrium
toward the most appropriate form for binding. Normal mode analysis is
proved to be useful in identifying the directions of conformational
changes between substates. In this study, we demonstrate that the
ratios of normalized weights of a few normal modes driving the protein
between its substates can give insights about the ratios of kinetic
conversion rates of the substates, although a direct relation between
the eigenvalues and kinetic conversion rates or populations of each
substate could not be observed. The correlation between the normalized
mode weight ratios and the kinetic rate ratios is around 83% on a set
of 11 non-enzyme proteins and around 59% on a set of 17 enzymes. The
results are suggestive that mode motions carry intrinsic relations

Multicomponent lipid bilayer membranes display rich phase transition and associated compositional lipid domain formation behavior. When both leaflets of the bilayer contain domains, they are often found co-localized across the leaflets, implying the presence of a thermodynamic interleaflet coupling. In this work, it is demonstrated that fluctuation-induced interactions between domains embedded within opposing membrane leaflets provide a robust means to co-localize the domains. In particular, it is shown via a combination of a mode-counting argument, a perturbative calculation, and a non-perturbative treatment of a special case, that spatial variations in membrane bending rigidity associated with lipid domains embedded within the background phase always lead to an attractive interleaflet coupling with a magnitude of ?0.01kBT/nm2 in simple model membrane systems. Finally, it is demonstrated that the fluctuation-induced coupling is very robust against membrane tension and substrate interactions."," O. Marsalek and T. E.

Abstract:Understanding the reactivity and spectroscopy of aqueous solutions at the atomistic level is crucial for the elucidation and design of chemical processes. However, the simulation of these systems requires addressing the formidable challenges of treating the quantum nature of both the electrons and nuclei. Exploiting our recently developed methods that provide acceleration by up to two orders of magnitude, we combine path integral simulations with on-the-fly evaluation of the electronic structure at the hybrid density functional theory level to capture the interplay between nuclear quantum effects and the electronic surface. Here we show that this combination provides accurate structure and dynamics, including the full infra-red and Raman spectra of liquid water. This allows us to demonstrate and explain the failings of lower-level density functionals for dynamics and vibrational spectroscopy when the nuclei are treated quantum mechanically. These insights thus provide a foundation for the reliable investigation of spectroscopy and reactivity in aqueous environments.","Molecular Dynamics Simulation of Water Transport Mechanisms through Nanoporous Boron Nitride and Graphene Multilayers

In this study, molecular dynamics simulations are used to investigate water transport mechanisms through hourglass-shaped pore structure in nanoporous boron nitride (BN) and graphene multilayers. An increase in water flux is evidenced as the gap between the layers increases, reaching a maximum of 41 and 43 at d=6 Å in BN and graphene multilayers, respectively. Moreover, the BN multilayer exhibits less flux compared to graphene due to large friction force and energy barrier. In BN, the friction force dramatically increases when the layers are strongly stacked (d=3.5 Å), whereas it would be independent of the layer separation when the layers are sufficiently spaced (d≥5 Å). In contrast, it was shown that the friction force is independent of the layer spacing in graphene. On the other hand, water molecules across the BN exhibits larger energy barriers compared to graphene when the layers are highly spaced at d=8 Å. In consistent with the result reported for the flux, the axial diffusion coefficient of water molecules in graphene increases with layer spacing, reaching a maximum of when the layers are spaced at d=6 Å.","H. Meshkin and F. Zhu, ""Thermodynamics of protein folding studied by umbrella sampling along a reaction coordinate of native contacts"" J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2017 ASAP Article.

Spontaneous transitions between the native and non-native protein conformations are normally rare events that hardly take place in typical unbiased molecular dynamics simulations. It was recently demonstrated that such transitions can be well described by a reaction coordinate, Q, that represents the collective fraction of the native contacts between the protein atoms. Here we attempt to use this reaction coordinate to enhance the conformational sampling. We perform umbrella sampling simulations with biasing potentials on Q for two model proteins, Trp-Cage and BBA, using the CHARMM force field. Hamiltonian replica exchange is implemented in these simulations to further facilitate the sampling. The simulations appear to have reached satisfactory convergence, resulting in unbiased free energies as a function of Q. In addition to the native structure, multiple folded conformations are identified in the reconstructed equilibrium ensemble. Some conformations without any native contacts nonetheless have rather compact geometries and are stabilized by hydrogen bonds not present in the native structure. Whereas the enhanced sampling along Q reasonably reproduces the equilibrium conformational space, we also find that the folding of an α-helix in Trp-Cage is a slow degree of freedom orthogonal to Q and therefore cannot be accelerated by biasing the reaction coordinate. Overall, we conclude that whereas Q is an excellent parameter to analyze the simulations, it is not necessarily a perfect reaction coordinate for enhanced sampling, and better incorporation of other slow degrees of freedom may further improve this reaction coordinate."

an efficient and robust treatment of large molecules while tolerating
different substituents. Various weighting functions can be used for
the calculation of RMSD values and similarity descriptors, and the
utilization of coordinate uncertainties allows for the calculation of
standard deviations for all calculated properties through error
propagation. A new three-dimensional (3D) graphical representation
that combines multiple aspects of structural information is presented

Biological mixtures such as the cytosol may consist of thousands of distinct components. There is now a substantial body of evidence showing that, under physiological conditions, intracellular mixtures can phase separate into spatially distinct regions with differing compositions. In this article we present numerical evidence indicating that such spontaneous compartmentalization exploits general features of the phase diagram of a multicomponent biomolecular mixture. In particular, we show that demixed domains are likely to segregate when the variance in the intermolecular interaction strengths exceeds a well-defined threshold. Multiple distinct phases are likely to become stable under very similar conditions, which can then be tuned to achieve multiphase coexistence. As a result, only minor adjustments to the composition of the cytosol or the strengths of the intermolecular interactions are needed to regulate the formation of different domains with specific compositions, implying that phase separation is a robust mechanism for creating spatial organization. We further predict that this functionality is only weakly affected by increasing the number of components in the system. Our model therefore suggests that, for purely physico-chemical reasons, biological mixtures are naturally poised to undergo a small number of demixing phase transitions."," D. Nocito and G. J. O.

Abstract:Evaluation of the self-consistent polarization energy forms a major computational bottleneck in polar- izable force fields. In large systems, the linear polarization equations are typically solved iteratively with techniques based on Jacobi iterations (JI) or preconditioned conjugate gradients (PCG). Two new variants of JI are proposed here that exploit domain decomposition to accelerate the convergence of the induced dipoles. The first, divide-and-conquer JI (DC-JI), is a block Jacobi algorithm which solves the polarization equations within non-overlapping sub-clusters of atoms directly via Cholesky decomposition, and iterates to capture interactions between sub-clusters. The second, fuzzy DC-JI, achieves further acceleration by employing overlapping blocks. Fuzzy DC-JI is analogous to an addi- tive Schwarz method, but with distance-based weighting when averaging the fuzzy dipoles from different blocks. Key to the success of these algorithms is the use of K-means clustering to identify natural atomic sub-clusters automatically for both algorithms and to determine the appropriate weights in fuzzy DC-JI. The algorithm employs knowledge of the 3-D spatial interactions to group important elements in the 2-D polarization matrix. When coupled with direct inversion in the iterative subspace (DIIS) extrapolation, fuzzy DC-JI/DIIS in particular converges in a comparable number of iterations as PCG, but with lower computational cost per iteration. In the end, the new algorithms demonstrated here accelerate the evaluation of the polarization energy by 2–3 fold compared to existing implementations of PCG or JI/DIIS.","ReaxFF Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Water Stability of Interpenetrated Metal–Organic Frameworks
Xiu Ying Liu, Sung Jin Pai, and Sang Soo Han The Journal of Physical Chemistry C Article ASAP DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b00676

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the reactive force field (ReaxFF) have been performed to elucidate the underlying water-induced disruption mechanism of several prototypical interpenetrated MOFs (IRMOF-9, IRMOF-13, and SUMOF-4). Through the comparison to the corresponding noninterpenetrated MOFs (IRMOF-10 and IRMOF-14), for both the interpenetrated and noninterpenetrated MOFs, structural collapse was always accompanied by the dissociation of the water molecules, with the produced OH– and H+ forming chemical bonds with the Zn2+ ion and O atom of the ligand, respectively. However, the water stability of the interpenetrated MOFs is less than that of the corresponding noninterpenetrated structures. The reasons for the differences between the MOFs in the resistance to water attack are clarified. The water resistance of the noninterpenetrated MOFs is mainly attributed to the strength of the Zn–Oligand, but, the hydrogen bond has little effect. However, a trade-off between the strength of the Zn–Oligand bond and the hydrogen bond determines the water stability of the interpenetrated MOFs. We expect that our understanding of the water-disruption mechanisms of MOFs will provide helpful guidance for the design of MOFs with a high water-resistance. Additionally, this work shows that ReaxFF simulations could be a useful technique for predicting the hydrothermal stability of MOFs.","R. Cossio-Perez, J. Palma, and G.

Moreover, the consistency of the modes can be systematically improved by adding more individual trajectories to the concatenated one."

""Coarse-grained polyethylene: 1. The simplest model for the
orthorhombic crystal"" Polymer Sci. A, 59 (2017): 149.

The coarse-grained model of polyethylene and alkanes (the united-atom
model, in which each CH2 group is represented by a single bead) was
proposed several decades ago. It is widely applied in molecular
dynamics simulations. For different tasks, the models with different
geometrical and force parameters are used. Until now, it was thought
that the coarse-grained model of polyethylene cannot reproduce the
orthorhombic crystalline phase, which is typical of this polymer. In
the present study, we analyze the simplest coarse-grained model of
polyethylene. In this model, the Lennard-Jones potential (6–12) is
adopted for van der Waals interactions between the beads of different
chains. Of the bonded interactions, only the “valence” bonds between
beads and the “bond” and “torsion” angles are taken into account,
whereas the cross terms between them are disregarded. We consider the
model variation in which the bead (the force center with the mass of a
CH2 group) is displaced from the center of the carbon atom and all the
interactions, both bonded and nonbonded, are defined by the positions
of these beads. For this model, we find the area of geometrical
parameters (the displacement value and the van der Waals radius of the
bead) in which all the three known crystalline phases of polyethylene
are at equilibrium at low temperatures. We choose the force field
constants for the model so that its oscillation spectrum reproduces
the low-frequency part of the inelastic neutron scattering spectrum of
the orthorhombic polyethylene. It proved to be that this choice can be
made unambiguously. We compare the dispersion curves in the terahertz
range with experimental data on the Raman scattering and infrared
spectroscopy, and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the
analyzed simplest coarse model.","Moraca, F.; Amato, J.; Ortuso, F.; Artese, A.; Pagano, B.; Novellino, E.; Alcaro, S.; Parrinello, M.; Limongelli, V. Ligand Binding to Telomeric G-Quadruplex DNA Investigated by Funnel-Metadynamics Simulations. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2017. ASAP

G-quadruplexes (G4s) are higher-order DNA structures typically present at promoter regions of genes and telomeres. Here, the G4 formation decreases the replicative DNA at each cell cycle, finally leading to apoptosis. The ability to control this mitotic clock, particularly in cancer cells, is fascinating and passes through a rational understanding of the ligand/G4 interaction. We demonstrate that an accurate description of the ligand/G4 binding mechanism is possible using an innovative free-energy method called funnel-metadynamics (FM), which we have recently developed to investigate ligand/protein interaction. Using FM simulations, we have elucidated the binding mechanism of the anticancer alkaloid berberine to the human telomeric G4 (d[AG3(T2AG3)3]), computing also the binding free-energy landscape. Two ligand binding modes have been identified as the lowest energy states. Furthermore, we have found prebinding sites, which are preparatory to reach the final binding mode. In our simulations, the ions and the water molecules have been explicitly represented and the energetic contribution of the solvent during ligand binding evaluated. Our theoretical results provide an accurate estimate of the absolute ligand/DNA binding free energy (ΔGb0 = −10.3 ± 0.5 kcal/mol) that we validated through steady-state fluorescence binding assays. The good agreement between the theoretical and experimental value demonstrates that FM is a most powerful method to investigate ligand/DNA interaction and can be a useful tool for the rational design also of G4 ligands.

Sergei Izvekov The Journal of Chemical Physics 2017 146:12

We consider the generalized Langevin equations of motion describing exactly the particle-based coarse-grained dynamics in the classical microscopic ensemble that were derived recently within the Mori-Zwanzig formalism based on new projection operators [S. Izvekov, J. Chem. Phys. 138(13), 134106 (2013)]. The fundamental difference between the new family of projection operators and the standard Zwanzig projection operator used in the past to derive the coarse-grained equations of motion is that the new operators average out the explicit irrelevant trajectories leading to the possibility of solving the projected dynamics exactly. We clarify the definition of the projection operators and revisit the formalism to compute the projected dynamics exactly for the microscopic system in equilibrium. The resulting expression for the projected force is in the form of a “generalized additive fluctuating force” describing the departure of the generalized microscopic force associated with the coarse-grained coordinate from its projection. Starting with this key expression, we formulate a new exact formula for the memory function in terms of microscopic and coarse-grained conservative forces. We conclude by studying two independent limiting cases of practical importance: the Markov limit (vanishing correlations of projected force) and the limit of weak dependence of the memory function on the particle momenta. We present computationally affordable expressions which can be efficiently evaluated from standard molecular dynamics simulations.","M. S. Miller, W. K. Lay, S. Li, W. C. Hacker, J. An, J.

There is a small, but growing, body of literature describing the use of osmotic coefficient measurements to validate and reparametrize simulation force fields. Here we have investigated the ability of five very commonly used force field and water model combinations to reproduce the osmotic coefficients of seven neutral amino acids and five small molecules. The force fields tested include AMBER ff99SB-ILDN, CHARMM36, GROMOS54a7, and OPLS-AA, with the first of these tested in conjunction with the TIP3P and TIP4P-Ew water models. In general, for both the amino acids and the small molecules, the tested force fields produce computed osmotic coefficients that are lower than experiment; this is indicative of excessively favorable solute–solute interactions. The sole exception to this general trend is provided by GROMOS54a7 when applied to amino acids: in this case, the computed osmotic coefficients are consistently too high. Importantly, we show that all of the force fields tested can be made to accurately reproduce the experimental osmotic coefficients of the amino acids when minor modifications–some previously reported by others and some that are new to this study–are made to the van der Waals interactions of the charged terminal groups. Special care is required, however, when simulating Proline with a number of the force fields, and a hydroxyl-group specific modification is required in order to correct Serine and Threonine when simulated with AMBER ff99SB-ILDN. Interestingly, an alternative parametrization of the van der Waals interactions in the latter force field, proposed by the Nerenberg and Head-Gordon groups, is shown to immediately produce osmotic coefficients that are in excellent agreement with experiment. Overall, this study reinforces the idea that osmotic coefficient measurements can be used to identify general shortcomings in commonly used force fields’ descriptions of solute–solute interactions and further demonstrates that modifications to van der Waals parameters provide a simple route to optimizing agreement with experiment."

represents a tunable packing parameter that manifests in the
spontaneous curvature of the amphiphile aggregates. Besides the

The results show that charged and polar interactions break more often than hydrophobic pairs. This pattern correlates strongly with the average solvent exposure of amino acids in globular proteins, as well as with polarity indices and the sizes of the amino acids. Knowledge-based entropies are derived by using the inverse Boltzmann relationship, in a manner analogous to the way that knowledge-based potentials have been extracted. Including these new knowledge-based entropies almost doubles the performance of knowledge-based potentials in selecting the native protein structures from decoy sets. Beyond the overall energy–entropy compensation, a similar compensation is seen for individual pairs of interacting amino acids. The entropies in this report have immediate applications for 3D structure prediction, protein model assessment, and protein engineering and design. ","M. Incerti, S. Russo, D. Callegari, D. Pala, C.

Abstract:
Metadynamics (META-D) is emerging as a powerful method for the computation of the multidimensional free-energy surface (FES) describing the protein–ligand binding process. Herein, the FES of unbinding of the antagonist N-(3α-hydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oyl)-l-β-homotryptophan (UniPR129) from its EphA2 receptor was reconstructed by META-D simulations. The characterization of the free-energy minima identified on this FES proposes a binding mode fully consistent with previously reported and new structure–activity relationship data. To validate this binding mode, new N-(3α-hydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oyl)-l-β-homotryptophan derivatives were designed, synthesized, and tested for their ability to displace ephrin-A1 from the EphA2 receptor. Among them, two antagonists, namely compounds 21 and 22, displayed high affinity versus the EphA2 receptor and resulted endowed with better physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties than the parent compound. These findings highlight the importance of free-energy calculations in drug design, confirming that META-D simulations can be used to successfully design novel bioactive compounds.","Wavelet Monte Carlo dynamics: A new algorithm for simulating the hydrodynamics of interacting Brownian particles
Oliver T. Dyer and Robin C. Ball The Journal of Chemical Physics 2017 146:12

We develop a new algorithm for the Brownian dynamics of soft matter systems that evolves time by spatially correlated Monte Carlo moves. The algorithm uses vector wavelets as its basic moves and produces hydrodynamics in the low Reynolds number regime propagated according to the Oseen tensor. When small moves are removed, the correlations closely approximate the Rotne-Prager tensor, itself widely used to correct for deficiencies in Oseen. We also include plane wave moves to provide the longest range correlations, which we detail for both infinite and periodic systems. The computational cost of the algorithm scales competitively with the number of particles simulated, N, scaling as N In N in homogeneous systems and as N in dilute systems. In comparisons to established lattice Boltzmann and Brownian dynamics algorithms, the wavelet method was found to be only a factor of order 1 times more expensive than the cheaper lattice Boltzmann algorithm in marginally semi-dilute simulations, while it is significantly faster than both algorithms at large N in dilute simulations. We also validate the algorithm by checking that it reproduces the correct dynamics and equilibrium properties of simple single polymer systems, as well as verifying the effect of periodicity on the mobility tensor.","J. P. Garrahan, ""Simple bounds on fluctuations and uncertainty relations for first-passage times of counting observables"" Phys. Rev. E 95, 032134 (2017).

Recent large deviation results have provided general lower bounds for the fluctuations of time-integrated currents in the steady state of stochastic systems. A corollary are so-called thermodynamic uncertainty relations connecting precision of estimation to average dissipation. Here we consider this problem but for counting observables, i.e., trajectory observables which, in contrast to currents, are non-negative and non-decreasing in time (and possibly symmetric under time reversal). In the steady state, their fluctuations to all orders are bound from below by a Conway-Maxwell-Poisson distribution dependent only on the averages of the observable and of the dynamical activity. We show how to obtain the corresponding bounds for first-passage times (times when a certain value of the counting variable is first reached) and their uncertainty relations. Just like entropy production does for currents, dynamical activity controls the bounds on fluctuations of counting observables."
"The Extended Generalized Adaptive Biasing Force Algorithm for Multidimensional Free-Energy Calculations
Tanfeng Zhao, Haohao Fu, Tony Lelièvre, Xueguang Shao, Christophe Chipot, and Wensheng Cai
Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation Just Accepted Manuscript
DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00032
Free-energy calculations in multiple dimensions constitute a challenging problem, owing to the significant computational cost incurred to achieve ergodic sampling. The generalized adaptive biasing force (gABF) algorithm calculates n one-dimensional lists of biasing forces to approximate the n-dimensional matrix by ignoring the coupling terms ordinarily taken into account in classical ABF simulations, thereby, greatly accelerating sampling in the multidimensional space. This approximation may however occasionally lead to poor, incomplete exploration of the conformational space compared to classical ABF, especially when the selected coarse variables are strongly coupled. It has been found that introducing extended potentials coupled to the coarse variables of interest can virtually eliminate this shortcoming, and, thus, improve the efficiency of gABF simulations. In the present contribution, we propose a new free-energy method, coined extended generalized ABF (egABF), combining gABF with an extended Lagrangian strategy. The results for three illustrative examples indicate that (i) egABF can explore the transition coordinate much more efficiently compared with classical ABF, eABF and gABF, in both simple and complex cases, and (ii) egABF can achieve a higher accuracy than gABF, with a root mean-squared deviation between egABF and eABF free-energy profiles on the order of kBT. Furthermore, the new egABF algorithm outruns the previous ABF-based algorithms in high-dimensional free-energy calculations, and, hence, represents a powerful importance-sampling alternative for the investigation of complex chemical and biological processes.

Theoretical and experimental studies have firmly established that protein folding can be described by a funneled energy landscape. This funneled energy landscape is the result of foldable protein sequences evolving following the principle of minimal frustration, which allows proteins to rapidly fold to their native biologically functional conformations. For a protein family with a given functional fold, the principle of minimal frustration suggests that, independent of sequence, all proteins within this family should fold with similar rates. However, depending on the optimal living temperature of the organism, proteins also need to modulate their thermodynamic stability. Consequently, the difference in thermodynamic stability should be primarily caused by differences in the unfolding rates. To test this hypothesis experimentally, we performed comprehensive thermodynamic and kinetic analyses of 15 different proteins from the thioredoxin family. Eight of these thioredoxins were extant proteins from psychrophilic, mesophilic, or thermophilic organisms. The other seven protein sequences were obtained using ancestral sequence reconstruction and can be dated back over 4 billion years. We found that all studied proteins fold with very similar rates but unfold with rates that differ up to three orders of magnitude. The unfolding rates correlate well with the thermodynamic stability of the proteins. Moreover, proteins that unfold slower are more resistant to proteolysis. These results provide direct experimental support to the principle of minimal frustration hypothesis. ","Suku, Eda, Fabrizio Fierro, Alejandro Giorgetti, Mercedes Alfonso-Prieto, and Paolo Carloni. ""Multi-scale simulations of membrane proteins: the case of bitter taste receptors."" Journal of Science: Advanced Materials and Devices (2017).

Human bitter taste receptors (hTAS2Rs) are the second largest group of chemosensory G-protein coupled receptors (25 members). hTAS2Rs are expressed in many tissues (e.g. tongue, gastrointestinal tract, respiratory system, brain, etc.), performing a variety of functions, from bitter taste perception to hormone secretion and bronchodilation. Due to the lack of experimental structural information, computations are currently the methods of choice to get insights into ligand–receptor interactions. Here we review our efforts at predicting the binding pose of agonists to hTAS2Rs, using state-of-the-art bioinformatics approaches followed by hybrid Molecular Mechanics/Coarse-Grained (MM/CG) simulations. The latter method, developed by us, describes atomistically only the agonist binding region, including hydration, and it may be particularly suited to be used when bioinformatics predictions generate very low-resolution models, such as the case of hTAS2Rs. Our structural predictions of the hTAS2R38 and hTAS2R46 receptors in complex with their agonists turn out to be fully consistent with experimental mutagenesis data. In addition, they suggest a two-binding site architecture in hTAS2R46, consisting of the usual orthosteric site together with a “vestibular” site toward the extracellular space, as observed in other GPCRs. The presence of the vestibular site may help to discriminate among the wide spectrum of bitter ligands.","Title: Structurally detailed coarse-grained model for Sec-facilitated co-translational protein translocation and membrane integration

Authors: Michiel J. M. Niesen, Connie Y. Wang, Reid C. Van Lehn and Thomas F. Miller III

Abstract: We present a coarse-grained simulation model that is capable of simulating the minute-timescale dynamics of protein translocation and membrane integration via the Sec translocon, while retaining sufficient chemical and structural detail to capture many of the sequence-specific interactions that drive these processes. The model includes accurate geometric representations of the ribosome and Sec translocon, obtained directly from experimental structures, and interactions parameterized from nearly 200 μs of residue-based coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. A protocol for mapping amino-acid sequences to coarse-grained beads enables the direct simulation of trajectories for the co-translational insertion of arbitrary polypeptide sequences into the Sec translocon. The model reproduces experimentally observed features of membrane protein integration, including the efficiency with which polypeptide domains integrate into the membrane, the variation in integration efficiency upon single amino-acid mutations, and the orientation of transmembrane domains. The central advantage of the model is that it connects sequence-level protein features to biological observables and timescales, enabling direct simulation for the mechanistic analysis of co-translational integration and for the engineering of membrane proteins with enhanced membrane integration efficiency.

Theodorou, ""Equation of state based slip spring model for entangled polymer dynamics"" Macromolecules 2017 ASAP Article.

A mesoscopic, mixed particle- and field-based Brownian dynamics methodology for the simulation of entangled polymer melts has been developed. Polymeric beads consist of several Kuhn segments, and their motion is dictated by the Helmholtz energy of the sample, which is a sum of the entropic elasticity of chain strands between beads, slip springs, and nonbonded interactions. Following earlier works in the field [ Phys. Rev. Lett. 2012, 109, 148302], the entanglement effect is introduced by the slip springs, which are springs connecting either nonsuccessive beads on the same chain or beads on different polymer chains. The terminal positions of slip springs are altered during the simulation through a kinetic Monte Carlo hopping scheme, with rate-controlled creation/destruction processes for the slip springs at chain ends. The rate constants are consistent with the free energy function employed and satisfy microscopic reversibility at equilibrium. The free energy of nonbonded interactions is derived from an appropriate equation of state, and it is computed as a functional of the local density by passing an orthogonal grid through the simulation box; accounting for it is necessary for reproducing the correct compressibility of the polymeric material. Parameters invoked by the mesoscopic model are derived from experimental volumetric and viscosity data or from atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, establishing a “bottom-up” predictive framework for conducting slip spring simulations of polymeric systems of specific chemistry. Initial configurations for the mesoscopic simulations are obtained by further coarse-graining of well-equilibrated structures represented at a greater level of detail. The mesoscopic simulation methodology is implemented for the case of cis-1,4-polyisoprene, whose structure, dynamics, thermodynamics, and linear rheology in the melt state are quantitatively predicted and validated without a posteriori fitting the results to experimental measurements."
"A molecular dynamics investigation of the influence of water structure on ion conduction through a carbon nanotube

doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4975690
Molecular dynamics simulations are employed to investigate pressure-driven water and ion transport through a (9,9) carbon nanotube (CNT). We consider NaCl solutions modeled with both the TIP3P and TIP4P/2005 water models.Concentrations range from 0.25 to 2.8 mol l−1 and temperatures from 260 to 320 K are considered. We discuss the influences on flow rates of continuum hydrodynamic considerations and molecular structural effects. We show that the flow rate of water, sodium, and chloride ions through the CNT is strongly model dependent, consistent with earlier simulations of pure water conduction.To remove the effects of different water flow rates, and clearly expose the influence of other factors on ion flow, we calculate ion transport efficiencies. Ion transport efficiencies are much smaller for TIP4P/2005 solutions than for those using the TIP3P model. Particularly at lower temperatures, the ion transport efficiencies for the TIP4P/2005 model are small, despite the fact that the nanotube conducts water at a significant rate. We trace the origin of small ion transport efficiencies to the presence of ring-like water structures within the CNT. Such structures occur commonly for the TIP4P/2005 model, but less frequently for TIP3P. The water structure acts to reduce ion “solvation” within the CNT, posing an additional barrier to ion entry and transport. Our results demonstrate that increasing the water structure within the CNT by decreasing the temperature strongly inhibits ion conduction, while still permitting significant water transport.","Coarse-Grained Molecular Modeling of the Solution Structure Ensemble of Dengue Virus Nonstructural Protein 5 with Small-Angle X-ray Scattering Intensity

An ensemble-modeling scheme incorporating coarse-grained simulations with experimental small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data is applied to dengue virus 2 (DENV2) nonstructural protein 5 (NS5). NS5 serves a key role in viral replication through its two domains that are connected by a 10-residue polypeptide segment. A set of representative structures is generated from a simulated structure pool using SAXS data fitting by the non-negativity least squares (NNLS) or standard ensemble optimization method (EOM) based on a genetic algorithm (GA). It is found that a proper low-energy threshold of the structure pool is necessary to produce a conformational ensemble of two representative structures by both NNLS and GA that agrees well with the experimental SAXS profile. The stability of the constructed ensemble is validated also by molecular dynamics simulations with an all-atom force field. The constructed ensemble successfully revealed the domain–domain orientation and domain-contacting interface of DENV2 NS5. Using experimental data fitting and additional investigations with synthesized data, it is found that energy restraint on the conformational pool is necessary to avoid overinterpretation of experimental data by spurious conformational representations.","Isaka, Yuta, Toru Ekimoto, Yuichi Kokabu, Ichiro Yamato, Takeshi Murata, and Mitsunori Ikeguchi. ""Rotation Mechanism of Molecular Motor V 1-ATPase Studied by Multiscale Molecular Dynamics Simulation."" Biophysical Journal 112, no. 5 (2017): 911-920.

Enterococcus hirae V1-ATPase is a molecular motor composed of the A3B3 hexamer ring and the central stalk. In association with ATP hydrolysis, three catalytic AB pairs in the A3B3 ring undergo conformational changes, which lead to a 120° rotation of the central stalk. To understand how the conformational changes of three catalytic pairs induce the 120° rotation of the central stalk, we performed multiscale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in which coarse-grained and all-atom MD simulations were combined using a fluctuation matching methodology. During the rotation, a catalytic AB pair spontaneously adopted an intermediate conformation, which was not included in the initial inputs of the simulations and was essentially close to the “bindable-like” structure observed in a recently solved crystal structure. Furthermore, the creation of a space between the bindable-like and tight pairs was required for the central stalk to rotate without steric hindrance. These cooperative rearrangements of the three catalytic pairs are crucial for the rotation of the central stalk.","Title: Stability and dynamics of membrane-spanning DNA nanopores

Abstract: Recently developed DNA-based analogues of membrane proteins have advanced synthetic biology. A fundamental question is how hydrophilic nanostructures reside in the hydrophobic environment of the membrane. Here, we use multiscale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to explore the structure, stability and dynamics of an archetypical DNA nanotube inserted via a ring of membrane anchors into a phospholipid bilayer. Coarse-grained MD reveals that the lipids reorganize locally to interact closely with the membrane-spanning section of the DNA tube. Steered simulations along the bilayer normal establish the metastable nature of the inserted pore, yielding a force profile with barriers for membrane exit due to the membrane anchors. Atomistic, equilibrium simulations at two salt concentrations confirm the close packing of lipid around of the stably inserted DNA pore and its cation selectivity, while revealing localized structural fluctuations. The wide-ranging and detailed insight informs the design of next-generation DNA pores for synthetic biology or biomedicine.

Unfortunately, analysis of these models to extract the relevant physics is never as easy as applying machine learning to a large dataset in the first place. Here we present a description of atomic systems that generates machine learning representations with a direct path to physical interpretation. As an example, we demonstrate its usefulness as a universal descriptor of grain boundary systems. Grain boundaries in crystalline materials are a quintessential example of a complex, high-dimensional system with broad impact on many physical properties including strength, ductility, corrosion resistance, crack resistance, and conductivity. In addition to modeling such properties, the method also provides insight into the physical ""building blocks"" that influence them. This opens the way to discover the underlying physics behind behaviors by understanding which building blocks map to particular properties. Once the structures are understood, they can then be optimized for desirable behaviors."

doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4975163
Based on all-atom Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of a lipid bilayer we present a systematic mapping on a 2D lattice model. Keeping the lipid type and the chain order parameter as key variables we derive a free energy functional, containing the enthalpic interaction of adjacent lipids as well as the tail entropy.The functional form of both functions is explicitly determined for saturated and polyunsaturated lipids. By studying the lattice model via Monte Carlo simulations it is possible to reproduce the temperature dependence of the distribution of order parameters of the pure lipids, including the prediction of the gel transition. Furthermore, application to a mixture of saturated and polyunsaturated lipids yields the correct phase separation behavior at lower temperatures with a simulation time reduced by approximately 7 orders of magnitude as compared to the corresponding MD simulations. Even the time-dependence of the de-mixing is reproduced on a semi-quantitative level. Due to the generality of the approach we envisage a large number of further applications, ranging from modeling larger sets of lipids, sterols, and solvent proteins to predicting nucleation barriers for the melting of lipids. Particularly, from the properties of the 2D lattice model one can directly read off the enthalpy and entropy change of the 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine gel-to-liquid transition in excellent agreement with experimental and MD results.","Many-Body Interactions in Ice

Many-body effects in ice are investigated through a systematic analysis of the lattice energies of several proton ordered and disordered phases, which are calculated with different flexible water models, ranging from pairwise additive (q-TIP4P/F) to polarizable (TTM3-F and AMOEBA) and explicit many-body (MB-pol) potential energy functions. Comparisons with available experimental and diffusion Monte Carlo data emphasize the importance of an accurate description of the individual terms of the many-body expansion of the interaction energy between water molecules for the correct prediction of the energy ordering of the ice phases. Further analysis of the MB-pol results, in terms of fundamental energy contributions, demonstrates that the differences in lattice energies between different ice phases are sensitively dependent on the subtle balance between short-range two-body and three-body interactions, many-body induction, and dispersion energy. By correctly reproducing many-body effects at both short range and long range, it is found that MB-pol accurately predicts the energetics of different ice phases, which provides further support for the accuracy of MB-pol in representing the properties of water from the gas to the condensed phase.","Invernizzi, Michele, Omar Valsson, and Michele Parrinello. ""Coarse graining from variationally enhanced sampling applied to the Ginzburg–Landau model."" Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (2017): 201618455.

A powerful way to deal with a complex system is to build a coarse-grained model capable of catching its main physical features, while being computationally affordable. Inevitably, such coarse-grained models introduce a set of phenomenological parameters, which are often not easily deducible from the underlying atomistic system. We present a unique approach to the calculation of these parameters, based on the recently introduced variationally enhanced sampling method. It allows us to obtain the parameters from atomistic simulations, providing thus a direct connection between the microscopic and the mesoscopic scale. The coarse-grained model we consider is that of Ginzburg–Landau, valid around a second-order critical point. In particular, we use it to describe a Lennard–Jones fluid in the region close to the liquid–vapor critical point. The procedure is general and can be adapted to other coarse-grained models.","Title: Anomalous Protein-Protein Interactions in Multivalent Salt Solution

Abstract: The stability of aqueous protein solutions is strongly affected by multivalent ions, which induce ion-ion correlations beyond the scope of classical mean-field theory. Using all-atom Molecular Dynamics (MD) and coarse grained Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, we investigate the interaction between a pair of protein molecules in 3:1 electrolyte solution. In agreement with available experimental findings of “reentrant protein condensation”, we observe an anomalous trend in the protein-protein potential of mean force with increasing electrolyte concentration in the order: (i) double-layer repulsion, (ii) ion-ion correlation attraction, (iii) over-charge repulsion, and in excess of 1:1 salt, (iv) non Coulombic attraction. To efficiently sample configurational space we explore hybrid continuum solvent models, applicable to many-protein systems, where weakly coupled ions are treated implicitly, while strongly coupled ones are treated explicitly. Good agreement is found with the primitive model of electrolytes, as well as with atomic models of protein and solvent.

Membrane scission is a crucial step in all budding processes, from endocytosis to viral budding. Many proteins have been associated with scission, though the underlying molecular details of how scission is accomplished often remain unknown. Here, we investigate the process of M2-mediated membrane scission during the budding of influenza viruses. Residues 50–61 of the viral M2 protein bind membrane and form an amphipathic α-helix (AH). Membrane binding requires hydrophobic interactions with the lipid tails but not charged interactions with the lipid headgroups. Upon binding, the M2AH induces membrane curvature and lipid ordering, constricting and destabilizing the membrane neck, causing scission. We further show that AHs in the cellular proteins Arf1 and Epsin1 behave in a similar manner. Together, they represent a class of membrane-induced AH domains that alter membrane curvature and fluidity, mediating the scission of constricted membrane necks in multiple biological pathways."

The conformational states adopted by a polymer chain in water are a result of a delicate balance between intra-molecular and water-mediated interactions. Using an explicit representation of the solvent is, however, computationally expensive and it is often necessary to turn to implicit representations. We present a systematic derivation of implicit models of water and study the effect of simplifying the representation of the solvent on the conformations of hydrophobic homopolymers of varying length. Starting from the explicit coarse-grained single site mW water model, we develop an implicit solvent model that reproduces the free energy of the contact pair between two hydrophobic monomers, an implicit solvent model that captures the free energy of contact pair minima, desolvation barrier, and solvent-separated minima, and finally, we consider vacuum simulations. We generate potentials of mean force for polymers of various lengths in explicit water, the implicit solvents and vacuum, using umbrella sampling and replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations. Surprisingly, vacuum simulations outperform the implicit solvent simulations, with the implicit model involving a desolvation barrier producing spurious extended polymer conformations.","Machine learning based interatomic potential for amorphous carbon

Volker L. Deringer and Gábor Csányi Phys. Rev. B 95, 094203 – Published 3 March 2017

We introduce a Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) for atomistic simulations of liquid and amorphous elemental carbon. Based on a machine learning representation of the density-functional theory (DFT) potential-energy surface, such interatomic potentials enable materials simulations with close-to DFT accuracy but at much lower computational cost. We first determine the maximum accuracy that any finite-range potential can achieve in carbon structures; then, using a hierarchical set of two-, three-, and many-body structural descriptors, we construct a GAP model that can indeed reach the target accuracy. The potential yields accurate energetic and structural properties over a wide range of densities; it also correctly captures the structure of the liquid phases, at variance with a state-of-the-art empirical potential. Exemplary applications of the GAP model to surfaces of “diamondlike” tetrahedral amorphous carbon (
ta
-C) are presented, including an estimate of the amorphous material's surface energy and simulations of high-temperature surface reconstructions (“graphitization”). The presented interatomic potential appears to be promising for realistic and accurate simulations of nanoscale amorphous carbon structures.","Quantum Dynamics and Spectroscopy of Ab Initio Liquid Water: The Interplay of Nuclear and Electronic Quantum Effects

Understanding the reactivity and spectroscopy of aqueous solutions at the atomistic level is crucial for the elucidation and design of chemical processes. However, the simulation of these systems requires addressing the formidable challenges of treating the quantum nature of both the electrons and nuclei. Exploiting our recently developed methods that provide acceleration by up to two orders of magnitude, we combine path integral simulations with on-the-fly evaluation of the electronic structure at the hybrid density functional theory level to capture the interplay between nuclear quantum effects and the electronic surface. Here we show that this combination provides accurate structure and dynamics, including the full infra-red and Raman spectra of liquid water. This allows us to demonstrate and explain the failings of lower-level density functionals for dynamics and vibrational spectroscopy when the nuclei are treated quantum mechanically. These insights thus provide a foundation for the reliable investigation of spectroscopy and reactivity in aqueous environments.","title: Diffusion under confinement: hydrodynamic finite-size effects in simulation

authors: Pauline Simonnin, Benoit Noetinger, Carlos Nieto-Draghi, Virginie Marry, and Benjamin Rotenberg

journal: arXiv:1703.05261v1

abstract: We investigate finite-size effects on diffusion in confined fluids using molecular dynamics simula- tions and hydrodynamic calculations. Specifically, we consider a Lennard-Jones fluid in slit pores without slip at the interface and show that the use of periodic boundary conditions in the directions along the surfaces results in dramatic finite-size effects, in addition to that of the physically relevant confining length. As in the simulation of bulk fluids, these effects arise from spurious hydrodynamic interactions between periodic images and from the constraint of total momentum conservation. We derive analytical expressions for the correction to the diffusion coefficient in the limits of both elongated and flat systems, which are in excellent agreement with the molecular simulation results except for the narrowest pores, where the discreteness of the fluid particles starts to play a role. The present work implies that the diffusion coefficients for wide nanopores computed using elon- gated boxes suffer from finite-size artifacts which had not been previously appreciated. In addition, our analytical expression provides the correction to be applied to the simulation results for finite (possibly small) systems. It applies not only to molecular but also to all mesoscopic hydrodynamic simulations, including Lattice-Boltzmann, Multi-Particle Collision Dynamics or Dissipative Particle Dynamics, which are often used to investigate confined soft matter involving colloidal particles and polymers.","Highly accurate computation of free energies in complex systems through horsetail QM/MM molecular dynamics combined with free-energy perturbation theory

We report a method to calculate very accurate free-energy values in complex systems using hybrid QM/MM approaches. The method combines the recently developed horsetail sampling technique in molecular dynamics and the dual-level technique derived from free-energy perturbation theory. The former is a particular type of multiple molecular dynamics that has been specifically designed for an efficient parallelization of QM/MM simulations. The latter allows estimating free-energy corrections at a high QM/MM level from a reference sampling obtained at a lower QM/MM level. The methodology is illustrated through the study of hydrogen peroxide at the vapor–liquid water interface, a system of considerable atmospheric and environmental relevance. We focus on the calculation of the free-energy profile for the torsional motion of the solute at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory. It is shown that the equilibrium angle is 87.7°, and that the free-energy barriers for cisoid and transoid transition states are 4.3 and 1.4 kcal/mol, respectively. These values are significantly different from the gas phase potential energy surface at the equivalent computational level (112.8°, 7.3 and 1.1 kcal/mol, respectively) suggesting that adsorption of hydrogen peroxide on water droplets could have major implications on its atmospheric chemistry."

Intercellular contacts in multicellular organisms are maintained by membrane receptors called cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) which are expressed on cell surfaces. One interesting feature of CAMs is that almost all of their extracellular regions contain repeating copies of structural domains. It is not clear why so many extracellular domains need to be evolved through natural selection. We tackled this problem by computational modeling. A generic model of CAMs was constructed based on domain organization of neuronal cell adhesion molecule (NrCAM), which is engaged in maintaining neuron–neuron adhesion in central nervous system. By placing these models on a cell–cell interface, we developed a Monte-Carlo simulation algorithm which incorporates both molecular factors including conformational changes of CAMs and cellular factor including fluctuations of plasma membranes to approach the physical process of CAM-mediated adhesion. We found that the presence of multiple domains at the extracellular region of a CAM plays a positive role in regulating its trans-interaction with other CAMs from opposite side of cell surfaces. The trans-interaction can further be facilitated by the intramolecular contacts between different extracellular domains of a CAM. Finally, if more than one CAM is introduced on each side of cell surfaces, the lateral binding (cis-interactions) between these CAMs will positively correlate with their trans-interactions only within a small energetic range, suggesting that cell adhesion is an elaborately designed process in which both trans and cis interactions are fine-tuned collectively by natural selection. In short, this study deepens our general understanding of the molecular mechanisms of cell adhesion.","Identifying the optimal anticancer targets from the landscape of a cancer–immunity interaction network

Chunhe Li Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2017, Advance Article DOI: 10.1039/C6CP07767F
Cancer immunotherapy, an approach of targeting immune cells to attack tumor cells, has been suggested to be a promising way for cancer treatment recently. However, the successful application of this approach warrants a deeper understanding of the intricate interplay between cancer cells and the immune system. Especially, the mechanisms of immunotherapy remain elusive. In this work, we constructed a cancer–immunity interplay network by incorporating interactions among cancer cells and some representative immune cells, and uncovered the potential landscape of the cancer–immunity network. Three attractors emerge on the landscape, representing the cancer state, the immune state, and the hybrid state, which can correspond to escape, elimination, and equilibrium phases in the immunoediting theory, respectively. We quantified the transition processes between the cancer state and the immune state by calculating transition actions and identifying the corresponding minimum action paths (MAPs) between these two attractors. The transition actions, directly calculated from the high dimensional system, are correlated with the barrier heights from the landscape, but provide a more precise description of the dynamics of a system. By optimizing the transition actions from the cancer state to the immune state, we identified some optimal combinations of anticancer targets. Our combined approach of the landscape and optimization of transition actions offers a framework to study the stochastic dynamics and identify the optimal combination of targets for the cancer–immunity interplay, and can be applied to other cell communication networks or gene regulatory networks.","Building a More Predictive Protein Force Field: A Systematic and Reproducible Route to AMBER-FB15

The increasing availability of high-quality experimental data and first-principles calculations creates opportunities for developing more accurate empirical force fields for simulation of proteins. We developed the AMBER-FB15 protein force field by building a high-quality quantum chemical data set consisting of comprehensive potential energy scans and employing the ForceBalance software package for parameter optimization. The optimized potential surface allows for more significant thermodynamic fluctuations away from local minima. In validation studies where simulation results are compared to experimental measurements, AMBER-FB15 in combination with the updated TIP3P-FB water model predicts equilibrium properties with equivalent accuracy, and temperature dependent properties with significantly improved accuracy, in comparison with published models. We also discuss the effect of changing the protein force field and water model on the simulation results.","title: Nuclear Quantum Effects on Aqueous Electron Attachment and Redox Properties

authors: Vladimir V. Rybkin  and Joost VandeVondele

journal: J. Phys. Chem. Lett., 2017, 8, pp 1424–1428

abstract: Nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) on the reduction and oxidation properties of small aqueous species (CO2, HO2, and O2) are quantified and rationalized by first-principles molecular dynamics and thermodynamic integration. Vertical electron attachment, or electron affinity, and detachment energies (VEA and VDE) are strongly affected by NQEs, decreasing in absolute value by 0.3 eV going from a classical to a quantum description of the nuclei. The effect is attributed to NQEs that lessen the solvent response upon oxidation/reduction. The reduction of solvent reorganization energy is expected to be general for small solutes in water. In the thermodynamic integral that yields the free energy of oxidation/reduction, these large changes enter with opposite sign, and only a small net effect (0.1 eV) remains. This is not obvious for CO2, where the integrand is strongly influenced by NQEs due to the onset of interaction of the reduced orbital with the conduction band of the liquid during thermodynamic integration. We conclude that NQEs might not have to be included in the computation of redox potentials, unless high accuracy is needed, but are important for VEA and VDE calculations.","H. Meshkin and F. Zhu, Thermodynamics of Protein Folding Studied by Umbrella Sampling along a Reaction Coordinate of Native Contacts, J. Chem. Theory Comput., Just Accepted Manuscript  
DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.6b01171

Abstract:
Spontaneous transitions between the native and non-native protein conformations are normally rare events that hardly take place in typical unbiased molecular dynamics simulations. It was recently demonstrated that such transitions can be well described by a reaction coordinate, Q, that represents the collective fraction of the native contacts between the protein atoms. Here we attempt to use this reaction coordinate to enhance the conformational sampling. We perform umbrella sampling simulations with biasing potentials on Q for two model proteins, Trp-Cage and BBA, using the CHARMM force field. Hamiltonian replica exchange is implemented in these simulations to further facilitate the sampling. The simulations appear to have reached satisfactory convergence, resulting in unbiased free energies as a function of Q. In addition to the native structure, multiple folded conformations are identified in the reconstructed equilibrium ensemble. Some conformations without any native contacts nonetheless have rather compact geometries and are stabilized by hydrogen bonds not present in the native structure. Whereas the enhanced sampling along Q reasonably reproduces the equilibrium conformational space, we also find that the folding of an α-helix in Trp-Cage is a slow degree of freedom orthogonal to Q and therefore cannot be accelerated by biasing the reaction coordinate. Overall, we conclude that whereas Q is an excellent parameter to analyze the simulations, it is not necessarily a perfect reaction coordinate for enhanced sampling, and better incorporation of other slow degrees of freedom may further improve this reaction coordinate."

In this study, we used the Martini Coarse-Grained model with no applied restraints to predict the binding mode of some peptides to G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs). Both the Neurotensin-1 and the chemokine CXCR4 receptors were used as test cases. Their ligands, NTS8-13 and CVX15 peptides, respectively, were initially positioned in the surrounding water box. Using a protocol based on Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics (REMD), both opening of the receptors and entry of the peptides into their dedicated pockets were observed on the μs time-scale. After clustering, the most statistically representative orientations were closely related to the X-ray structures of reference, sharing both RMSD lower than 3 Å and most of the native contacts. These results demonstrate that such a model, that does not require access to tremendous computational facilities, can be helpful in predicting peptide binding to GPCRs as well as some of the receptor’s conformational changes required for this key step. We also discuss how such an approach can now help to predict, de novo, the interactions of GPCRs with other intra- or extra-cellular peptide/protein partners.","Comparison of Implicit and Explicit Solvent Models for the Calculation of Solvation Free Energy in Organic Solvents
Jin Zhang, Haiyang Zhang, Tao Wu, Qi Wang, and David van der Spoel Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation Article ASAP DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00169

Quantitative prediction of physical properties of liquids is important for many applications. Computational methods based on either explicit or implicit solvent models can be used to approximate thermodynamics properties of liquids. Here, we evaluate the predictive power of implicit solvent models for solvation free energy of organic molecules in organic solvents. We compared the results calculated with four generalized Born (GB) models (GBStill, GBHCT, GBOBCI, and GBOBCII), the Poisson–Boltzmann (PB) model, and the density-based solvent model SMD with previous solvation free energy calculations (Zhang et al. J. Chem. Inf. Model.2015, 55, 1192–1201) and experimental data. The comparison indicates that both PB and GB give poor agreement with explicit solvent calculations and even worse agreement with experiments (root-mean-square deviation ≈ 15 kJ/mol). The main problem seems to be the prediction of the apolar contribution, which should include the solvent entropy. The quantum mechanical-based SMD model gives significantly better agreement with experimental data than do PB or GB, but it is not as good as explicit solvent calculation results. The dielectric constant ε of the solvent is found to be a powerful predictor for the polar contribution to the free energy in implicit models; however, the Onsager relation may not hold for realistic solvent, as suggested by explicit solvent and SMD calculations. From the comparison, we also find that with an optimization of the apolar contribution, the PB model gives slightly better agreement with experiments than the SMD model, whereas the correlation between the optimized GB models and experiments remains poor. Further optimization of the apolar contribution is needed for GB models to be able to treat solvents other than water.","Computing converged free energy differences between levels of theory via nonequilibrium work methods: Challenges and opportunities
FL. Kearns, PS. Hudson, HL. Woodcock, S. Boresch. J. Comput. Chem. 2016, DOI: 10.1002/jcc.24706
We demonstrate that Jarzynski's equation can be used to reliably compute free energy differences between low and high level representations of systems. The need for such a calculation arises when employing the so-called “indirect” approach to free energy simulations with mixed quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) Hamiltonians; a popular technique for circumventing extensive simulations involving quantum chemical computations. We have applied this methodology to several small and medium sized organic molecules, both in the gas phase and explicit solvent. Test cases include several systems for which the standard approach; that is, free energy perturbation between low and high level description, fails to converge. Finally, we identify three major areas in which the difference between low and high level representations make the calculation of  difficult: bond stretching and angle bending, different preferred conformations, and the response of the MM region to the charge distribution of the QM region.","title: Minimum energetic cost to maintain a target nonequilibrium state

authors: Jordan M. Horowitz, Kevin Zhou, and Jeremy L. England

journal: arXiv:1703.04722v1

abstract: In the absence of external driving, a system exposed to thermal fluctuations will relax to equilibrium. However, the constant input of work makes it possible to counteract this relaxation, and maintain the system in a nonequilibrium steady state. In this Article, we use the stochastic thermodynamics of Markov jump processes to compute the minimum rate at which energy must be supplied and dissipated to maintain an arbitrary nonequilibrium distribution in a given energy landscape. This lower bound depends on two factors: the undriven probability current in the equilibrium state, and the distance from thermal equilibrium of the target distribution. By showing the consequences of this result in a few simple examples, we suggest general implications for the required energetic costs of macromolecular repair and cytosolic protein localization.","A.

Backbone potentials of coarse-grained polypeptide chains, J. Chem. Phys. 146, 124106 (2017)

Abstract: 
A general and systematic method for the derivation of the functional expressions for the effective energy terms in coarse-grained force fields of polymer chains is proposed. The method is based on the expansion of the potential of mean force of the system studied in the cluster-cumulant series and expanding the all-atom energy in the Taylor series in the squares of interatomic distances about the squares of the distances between coarse-grained centers, to obtain approximate analytical expressions for the cluster cumulants. The primary degrees of freedom to average about are the angles for collective rotation of the atoms contained in the coarse-grained interaction sites about the respective virtual-bond axes. The approach has been applied to the revision of the virtual-bond-angle, virtual-bond-torsional, and backbone-local-and-electrostatic correlation potentials for the UNited RESidue (UNRES) model of polypeptide chains, demonstrating the strong dependence of the torsional and correlation potentials on virtual-bond angles, not considered in the current UNRES. The theoretical considerations are illustrated with the potentials calculated from the ab initio potential-energy surface of terminally blocked alanine by numerical integration and with the statistical potentials derived from known protein structures. The revised torsional potentials correctly indicate that virtual-bond angles close to 90◦ result in the preference for the turn and helical structures, while large virtual-bond angles result in the preference for polyproline II and extended backbone geometry. The revised correlation potentials correctly reproduce the preference for the formation of β-sheet structures for large values of virtual- bond angles and for the formation of α-helical structures for virtual-bond angles close to 90◦."

Molecular modeling of lipid membranes has been an evolving field over the last 40 years. This chapter provides a brief historical background of simulations and provides an introductory overview of computational membrane modeling at the molecular level. The development of lipid force fields (FFs) at various levels (atomistic to coarse grained) has allowed for accurate descriptions of membrane properties. The current diversity in lipids available in FFs currently allows researchers to model representative membrane models across the biota spectrum. Modeling is not limited to lipids, and many functional studies of cellular membranes focus on membrane-associated proteins that reside in or interact with the surface of the membrane. The field of molecular membrane modeling is in an exciting stage to grow and investigate a wide array of biological phenomena.","Title: Capturing the Multiscale Dynamics of Membrane Protein Complexes with All-Atom, Mixed-Resolution, and Coarse-Grained Models

Abstract: The structures and dynamics of protein complexes are often challenging to model in heterogeneous environments such as biological membranes. Herein, we meet this fundamental challenge at attainable cost with all-atom, mixed-resolution, and coarse-grained models of vital membrane proteins. We systematically simulated five complex models formed by two distinct G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in the lipid-bilayer membrane on the ns-to-μs timescales. These models, which suggest the swinging motion of an intracellular loop, for the first time, provide the molecular details for the regulatory role of such a loop. For the models at different resolution, we observed consistent structural stability but various levels of speed-ups in the protein dynamics. The mixed-resolution and coarse-grained models show two and four times faster protein diffusion than the all-atom models, in addition to a 4- and 400-fold speedup in the simulation performance. Furthermore, by elucidating the strengths and challenges of combining all-atom with reduced resolution models, this study can serve as a guide to simulating other complex systems in heterogeneous environments efficiently.

We derive alternative Markov approximations for the projected

the center-of-mass coordinates of clusters of particles in the
microscopic ensemble. This is done with the aid of the Mori-Zwanzig

operator [S. Izvekov, J. Chem. Phys. 138, 134106 (2013)]. The
derivation exploits the “generalized additive fluctuating force”
representation to which the projected force reduces in the adopted
projection operator formalism. For the projected force, we present a
first-order time expansion which correctly extends the static
fluctuating force ansatz with the terms necessary to maintain the
required orthogonality of the projected dynamics in the Markov limit
to the space of CG phase variables. The approximant of the memory
function correctly accounts for the momentum dependence in the lowest
(second) order and indicates that such a dependence may be important
in the CG dynamics approaching the Markov limit. In the case of CG
dynamics with a weak dependence of the memory effects on the particle
momenta, the expression for the memory function presented in this work
is applicable to non-Markov systems. The approximations are formulated
in a propagator-free form allowing their efficient evaluation from the
microscopic data sampled by standard molecular dynamics simulations. A
numerical application is presented for a molecular liquid

Abstract We consider the generalized Langevin equations of motion describing exactly the particle-based coarse-grained dynamics in the classical microscopic ensemble that were derived recently within the Mori-Zwanzig formalism based on new projection operators [S. Izvekov, J. Chem. Phys. 138(13), 134106 (2013)]. The fundamental difference between the new family of projection operators and the standard Zwanzig projection operator used in the past to derive the coarse-grained equations of motion is that the new operators average out the explicit irrelevant trajectories leading to the possibility of solving the projected dynamics exactly. We clarify the definition of the projection operators and revisit the formalism to compute the projected dynamics exactly for the microscopic system in equilibrium. The resulting expression for the projected force is in the form of a “generalized additive fluctuating force” describing the departure of the generalized microscopic force associated with the coarse-grained coordinate from its projection. Starting with this key expression, we formulate a new exact formula for the memory function in terms of microscopic and coarse-grained conservative forces. We conclude by studying two independent limiting cases of practical importance: the Markov limit (vanishing correlations of projected force) and the limit of weak dependence of the memory function on the particle momenta. We present computationally affordable expressions which can be efficiently evaluated from standard molecular dynamics simulations.","A. Renevey and S.

Abstract: Reducing the number of degrees of freedom in molecular models—so-called coarse-graining—is a popular approach to increase the accessible time scales and system sizes in molecular dynamics simulations. It involves, however, per sea loss of information. In order to retain a high accuracy in the region of interest, hybrid methods that combine two levels of resolution in a single system are an attractive trade-off. Hybrid atomistic (AT)/coarse-grained (CG) simulations have previously been shown to preserve the secondary structureelements of AT proteins in CG water but to cause an artificial increase in intramolecular hydrogen bonds, resulting in a reduced flexibility of the proteins. Recently, it was found that the AT-CG interactions employed in these simulations were too favourable for apolar solutes and not favourable enough for polar solutes. Here, the AT-CG interactions are reparametrised to reproduce the solvation free energy of a series of AT alkanes and side-chain analogues in CG water,while retaining the good mixing behaviour of AT water with CG water. The new AT-CG parameters are tested in hybrid simulations of four proteins in CG water. Structural and dynamic properties are compared to those obtained in fully AT simulations and, if applicable, to experimental data. The results show that the artificial increase of intramolecular hydrogen bonds is drastically reduced, leading to a better reproduction of the structural properties and flexibility of the proteins in atomistic water, without the need for an atomistic solvent layer."

Abstract:
Many state-of-the-art methods for the thermodynamic and kinetic characterization of large and complex biomolecular systems by simulation rely on ensemble approaches, where data from large numbers of relatively short trajectories are integrated. In this context, Markov state models (MSMs) are extremely popular because they can be used to compute stationary quantities and long-time kinetics from ensembles of short simulations, provided that these short simulations are in “local equilibrium” within the MSM states. However, over the last 15 years since the inception of MSMs, it has been controversially discussed and not yet been answered how deviations from local equilibrium can be detected, whether these deviations induce a practical bias in MSM estimation, and how to correct for them. In this paper, we address these issues: We systematically analyze the estimation of MSMs from short non-equilibrium simulations, and we provide an expression for the error between unbiased transition probabilities and the expected estimate from many short simulations. We show that the unbiased MSM estimate can be obtained even from relatively short non-equilibrium simulations in the limit of long lag times and good discretization. Further, we exploit observable operator model (OOM) theory to derive an unbiased estimator for the MSM transition matrix that corrects for the effect of starting out of equilibrium, even when short lag times are used. Finally, we show how the OOM framework can be used to estimate the exact eigenvalues or relaxation time scales of the system without estimating an MSM transition matrix, which allows us to practically assess the discretization quality of the MSM. Applications to model systems and molecular dynamics simulationdata of alanine dipeptide are included for illustration. The improved MSM estimator is implemented in PyEMMA of version 2.3.","Title: Knowledge-based entropies improve the identification of native protein structures

Authors: Kannan Sankar, Kejue Jia and Robert L. Jernigan

Abstract: Evaluating protein structures requires reliable free energies with good estimates of both potential energies and entropies. Although there are many demonstrated successes from using knowledge-based potential energies, computing entropies of proteins has lagged far behind. Here we take an entirely different approach and evaluate knowledge-based conformational entropies of proteins based on the observed frequencies of contact changes between amino acids in a set of 167 diverse proteins, each of which has two alternative structures. The results show that charged and polar interactions break more often than hydrophobic pairs. This pattern correlates strongly with the average solvent exposure of amino acids in globular proteins, as well as with polarity indices and the sizes of the amino acids. Knowledge-based entropies are derived by using the inverse Boltzmann relationship, in a manner analogous to the way that knowledge-based potentials have been extracted. Including these new knowledge-based entropies almost doubles the performance of knowledge-based potentials in selecting the native protein structures from decoy sets. Beyond the overall energy–entropy compensation, a similar compensation is seen for individual pairs of interacting amino acids. The entropies in this report have immediate applications for 3D structure prediction, protein model assessment, and protein engineering and design.

Abstract Recently developed DNA-based analogues of membrane proteins have advanced synthetic biology. A fundamental question is how hydrophilic nanostructures reside in the hydrophobic environment of the membrane. Here, we use multiscale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to explore the structure, stability and dynamics of an archetypical DNA nanotube inserted via a ring of membrane anchors into a phospholipid bilayer. Coarse-grained MD reveals that the lipids reorganize locally to interact closely with the membrane-spanning section of the DNA tube. Steered simulations along the bilayer normal establish the metastable nature of the inserted pore, yielding a force profile with barriers for membrane exit due to the membrane anchors. Atomistic, equilibrium simulations at two salt concentrations confirm the close packing of lipid around of the stably inserted DNA pore and its cation selectivity, while revealing localized structural fluctuations. The wide-ranging and detailed insight informs the design of next-generation DNA pores for synthetic biology or biomedicine.","J. A. Graham, J. W. Essex and S.

Abstract: Development of coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics models is often a laborious process which commonly relies upon approximations to similar models, rather than systematic parametrisation. PyCGTOOL automates much of the construction of CG models via calculation of both equilibrium values and force constants of internal coordinates directly from atomistic molecular dynamics simulation trajectories. The derivation of bespoke parameters from atomistic simulations improves the quality of the CG model compared to the use of generic parameters derived from other molecules, while automation greatly reduces the time required. The ease of conguration of PyCGTOOL enables the rapid investigation of multiple atom-to-bead mappings and topologies.

Abstract:
We study the statistics of infima, stopping times, and passage probabilities of entropy production in nonequilibrium steady states, and we show that they are universal. We consider two examples of stopping times: first-passage times of entropy production and waiting times of stochastic processes, which are the times when a system reaches a given state for the first time. Our main results are as follows: (i) The distribution of the global infimum of entropy production is exponential with mean equal to minus Boltzmann’s constant; (ii) we find exact expressions for the passage probabilities of entropy production; (iii) we derive a fluctuation theorem for stopping-time distributions of entropy production. These results have interesting implications for stochastic processes that can be discussed in simple colloidal systems and in active molecular processes. In particular, we show that the timing and statistics of discrete chemical transitions of molecular processes, such as the steps of molecular motors, are governed by the statistics of entropy production. We also show that the extreme-value statistics of active molecular processes are governed by entropy production; for example, we derive a relation between the maximal excursion of a molecular motor against the direction of an external force and the infimum of the corresponding entropy-production fluctuations. Using this relation, we make predictions for the distribution of the maximum backtrack depth of RNA polymerases, which follow from our universal results for entropy-production infamy.","Title: How Molecular Size Impacts RMSD Applications in Molecular Dynamics Simulations

Authors: Karen Sargsyan, Cedric Grauffel, and Carmay Lim

Abstract: The root mean square deviation (RMSD) is a similarity measure widely used in analysis of macromolecular structures and dynamics. As increasingly larger macromolecular systems are being studied, dimensionality effects such as the “curse of dimensionality” (a diminishing ability to discriminate pairwise differences between conformations with increasing system size) may exist and significantly impact RMSD-based analyses. For such large bimolecular systems, whether the RMSD or other alternative similarity measures might suffer from this “curse” and lose the ability to discriminate different macromolecular structures had not been explicitly addressed. Here, we show such dimensionality effects for both weighted and non-weighted RMSD schemes. We also provide a mechanism for the emergence of the “curse of dimensionality” for RMSD from the law of large numbers by showing that the conformational distributions from which RMSDs are calculated become increasingly similar as the system size increases. Our findings suggest the use of weighted RMSD schemes for small proteins (less than 200 residues) and non-weighted RMSD for larger proteins when analyzing molecular dynamics trajectories.

reduced by up to ∼75%. We discuss and present optimized training sets

same properties in similar but unrelated molecular sets.","Title: Reducing the number of mean-square deviation calculations with floating close structure in metadynamics

Abstract Metadynamics is an important collective-coordinate-based enhanced sampling simulation method. Its performance depends significantly on the capability of collective coordinates to describe the studied molecular processes. Collective coordinates based on comparison with reference landmark structures can be used to enhance sampling in highly complex systems; however, they may slow down simulations due to high number of structure-structure distance (e.g., mean-square deviation) calculations. Here we introduce an approximation of root-mean-square or mean-square deviation that significantly reduces numbers of computationally expensive operations. We evaluate its accuracy and theoretical performance gain with metadynamics simulations on two molecular systems.","Sieradzan, Adam K., Mariusz Makowski, Antoni Augustynowicz, and Adam Liwo.

A general and systematic method for the derivation of the functional expressions for the effective energy terms in coarse-grained force fields of polymer chains is proposed. The method is based on the expansion of the potential of mean force of the system studied in the cluster-cumulant series and expanding the all-atom energy in the Taylor series in the squares of interatomic distances about the squares of the distances between coarse-grained centers, to obtain approximate analytical expressions for the cluster cumulants. The primary degrees of freedom to average about are the angles for collective rotation of the atoms contained in the coarse-grained interaction sites about the respective virtual-bond axes. The approach has been applied to the revision of the virtual-bond-angle, virtual-bond-torsional, and backbone-local-and-electrostatic correlation potentials for the UNited RESidue (UNRES) model of polypeptide chains, demonstrating the strong dependence of the torsional and correlation potentials on virtual-bond angles, not considered in the current UNRES. The theoretical considerations are illustrated with the potentials calculated from the ab initio potential-energy surface of terminally blocked alanine by numerical integration and with the statistical potentials derived from known protein structures. The revised torsional potentials correctly indicate that virtual-bond angles close to 90° result in the preference for the turn and helical structures, while large virtual-bond angles result in the preference for polyproline II and extended backbone geometry. The revised correlation potentials correctly reproduce the preference for the formation of β-sheet structures for large values of virtual-bond angles and for the formation of α-helical structures for virtual-bond angles close to 90°."

Abstract:Free-energy calculations in multiple dimensions constitute a challenging problem, owing to the significant computational cost incurred to achieve ergodic sampling. The generalized adaptive biasing force (gABF) algorithm calculates n one-dimensional lists of biasing forces to approximate the n-dimensional matrix by ignoring the coupling terms ordinarily taken into account in classical ABF simulations, thereby, greatly accelerating sampling in the multidimensional space. This approximation may however occasionally lead to poor, incomplete exploration of the conformational space compared to classical ABF, especially when the selected coarse variables are strongly coupled. It has been found that introducing extended potentials coupled to the coarse variables of interest can virtually eliminate this shortcoming, and, thus, improve the efficiency of gABF simulations. In the present contribution, we propose a new free-energy method, coined extended generalized ABF (egABF), combining gABF with an extended Lagrangian strategy. The results for three illustrative examples indicate that (i) egABF can explore the transition coordinate much more efficiently compared with classical ABF, eABF and gABF, in both simple and complex cases, and (ii) egABF can achieve a higher accuracy than gABF, with a root mean-squared deviation between egABF and eABF free-energy profiles on the order of kBT. Furthermore, the new egABF algorithm outruns the previous ABF-based algorithms in high-dimensional free-energy calculations, and, hence, represents a powerful importance-sampling alternative for the investigation of complex chemical and biological processes.","Title: Navigating at Will on the Water Phase Diagram

Abstract: A major challenge of materials science is nowadays the synthesis of new predicted polymorphic structures with desired properties. Atomistic simulations combined with enhanced sampling techniques [1] provide a powerful computational tool for investigating the mechanism and the energetics of transformations in materials, but the standard approaches for phase transitions lack of transferability. Despite the simplicity of its molecular unit, water is a challenging system in this context because of its uniquely rich polymorphism [2] and predicted but yet unconfirmed features [3, 4]. Here we show that using a novel set of coordinates, capturing changes in the topology of the interatomic network, we are able to systematically track transitions among liquid, amorphous and crystalline forms throughout the whole phase diagram of water, including the nucleation of crystals [5] above and below the melting point. Our general approach is not specific to water and could be applied to any structural phase transition, including those occurring in oxides and metals.",,"Title: Wavelet Monte Carlo dynamics: A new algorithm for simulating the hydrodynamics of interacting Brownian particles

Abstract We develop a new algorithm for the Brownian dynamics of soft matter systems that evolves time by spatially correlated Monte Carlo moves. The algorithm uses vector wavelets as its basic moves and produces hydrodynamics in the low Reynolds number regime propagated according to the Oseen tensor. When small moves are removed, the correlations closely approximate the Rotne-Prager tensor, itself widely used to correct for deficiencies in Oseen. We also include plane wave moves to provide the longest range correlations, which we detail for both infinite and periodic systems. The computational cost of the algorithm scales competitively with the number of particles simulated, N, scaling as N In N in homogeneous systems and as N in dilute systems. In comparisons to established lattice Boltzmann and Brownian dynamics algorithms, the wavelet method was found to be only a factor of order 1 times more expensive than the cheaper lattice Boltzmann algorithm in marginally semi-dilute simulations, while it is significantly faster than both algorithms at large N in dilute simulations. We also validate the algorithm by checking that it reproduces the correct dynamics and equilibrium properties of simple single polymer systems, as well as verifying the effect of periodicity on the mobility tensor.","Sequence dependent aggregation of peptides and fibril formation

Deciphering the links between amino acid sequence and amyloid fibril formation is key for understanding protein misfolding diseases. Here we use Monte Carlo simulations to study aggregation of short peptides in a coarse-grained model with hydrophobic-polar (HP) amino acid sequences and correlated side chain orientations for hydrophobic contacts. A significant heterogeneity is observed in the aggregate structures and in the thermodynamics of aggregation for systems of different HP sequences and different number of peptides. Fibril-like ordered aggregates are found for several sequences that contain the common HPH pattern while other sequences may form helix bundles or disordered aggregates. A wide variation of the aggregation transition temperatures among sequences, even among those of the same hydrophobic fraction, indicates that not all sequences undergo aggregation at a presumable physiological temperature. The transition is found to be the most cooperative and first-order like for sequences forming fibril-like structures. For a fibril-prone sequence, it is shown that fibril formation follows the nucleation and growth mechanism. Interestingly, a binary mixture of peptides of an aggregation-prone and a non-aggregation-prone sequence shows association and conversion of the latter to the fibrillar structure. Our study highlights the role of sequence in selecting fibril-like aggregates and also the impact of structural template on fibril formation by peptides of unrelated sequences."

Abstract: Understanding the behavior of molecules interacting with superfluid helium represents a formidable challenge and, in general, requires approaches relying on large-scale numerical simulations. Here, we demonstrate that experimental data collected over the last 20 years provide evidence that molecules immersed in superfluid helium form recently predicted angulon quasiparticles [Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 203001 (2015)]. Most important, casting the many-body problem in terms of angulons amounts to a drastic simplification and yields effective molecular moments of inertia as straightforward analytic solutions of a simple microscopic Hamiltonian. The outcome of the angulon theory is in good agreement with experiment for a broad range of molecular impurities, from heavy to medium-mass to light species. These results pave the way to understanding molecular rotation in liquid and crystalline phases in terms of the angulon quasiparticle.","Title: Many-Body Interactions in Ice

Abstract: Many-body effects in ice are investigated through a systematic analysis of the lattice energies of several proton ordered and disordered phases, which are calculated with different flexible water models, ranging from pairwise additive (q-TIP4P/F) to polarizable (TTM3-F and AMOEBA) and explicit many-body (MB-pol) potential energy functions. Comparisons with available experimental and diffusion Monte Carlo data emphasize the importance of an accurate description of the individual terms of the many-body expansion of the interaction energy between water molecules for the correct prediction of the energy ordering of the ice phases. Further analysis of the MB-pol results, in terms of fundamental energy contributions, demonstrates that the differences in lattice energies between different ice phases are sensitively dependent on the subtle balance between short-range two-body and three-body interactions, many-body induction, and dispersion energy. By correctly reproducing many-body effects at both short range and long range, it is found that MB-pol accurately predicts the energetics of different ice phases, which provides further support for the accuracy of MB-pol in representing the properties of water from the gas to the condensed phase.",,"Title: A Network of Conformational Transitions in the Apo Form of NDM-1 Enzyme Revealed by MD Simulation and a Markov State Model

Abstract New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) is a novel β-Lactamase enzyme that confers enteric bacteria with nearly complete resistance to all β-lactam antibiotics, so raises a formidable and global threat to human health. However, the binding mechanism between apo-NDM-1 and antibiotics as well as related conformational changes remains poorly understood, which largely hinders the overcoming of its antibiotic resistance. In our study, long-time conventional molecular dynamics simulation and Markov state models were applied to reveal both dynamical and conformational landscape of apo-NDM-1: the MD simulation demonstrates that the loop L3, which is responsible for antibiotic binding, is the most flexible and undergoes dramatic conformational changes; moreover, the Markov state model built from the simulation maps four metastable states including open, semi-open and closed conformations of the loop L3 as well as frequent transitions between the states. Our findings propose a possible conformational selection model for the binding mechanism between apo-NDM-1 and antibiotics, which facilitates the design of novel inhibitors and antibiotics.

Development of coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics models is often a laborious process which commonly relies upon approximations to similar models, rather than systematic parametrisation. PyCGTOOL automates much of the construction of CG models via calculation of both equilibrium values and force constants of internal coordinates directly from atomistic molecular dynamics simulation trajectories. The derivation of bespoke parameters from atomistic simulations improves the quality of the CG model compared to the use of generic parameters derived from other molecules, while automation greatly reduces the time required. The ease of conguration of PyCGTOOL enables the rapid investigation of multiple atom-to-bead mappings and topologies. Although we present PyCGTOOL used in combination with the GROMACS molecular dynamics engine its use of standard trajectory input libraries means that it is in principle compatible with other software."

Journal: arXiv:1703.00776v1

Abstract: Cellular membranes exhibit a large variety of shapes, strongly coupled to their function. Many biological processes involve dynamic reshaping of membranes, usually mediated by proteins. This interaction works both ways: while proteins influence the membrane shape, the membrane shape affects the interactions between the proteins. To study these membrane-mediated interactions on closed and anisotropically curved membranes, we use colloids adhered to ellipsoidal membrane vesicles as a model system. We find that two particles on a closed system always attract each other, and tend to align with the direction of largest curvature. Multiple particles form arcs, or, at large enough numbers, a complete ring surrounding the vesicle in its equatorial plane. The resulting vesicle shape resembles a snowman. Our results indicate that these physical interactions on membranes with anisotropic shapes can be exploited by cells to drive macromolecules to preferred regions of cellular or intracellular membranes, and utilized to initiate dynamic processes such as cell division. The same principle could be used to find the midplane of an artificial vesicle, as a first step towards dividing it into two equal parts.",,"Title: Anomalous Protein-Protein Interactions in Multivalent Salt Solution

Abstract The stability of aqueous protein solutions is strongly affected by multivalent ions, which induce ion-ion correlations beyond the scope of classical mean-field theory. Using all-atom Molecular Dynamics (MD) and coarse grained Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, we investigate the interaction between a pair of protein molecules in 3:1 electrolyte solution. In agreement with available experimental findings of “reentrant protein condensation”, we observe an anomalous trend in the protein-protein potential of mean force with increasing electrolyte concentration in the order: (i) double-layer repulsion, (ii) ion-ion correlation attraction, (iii) over-charge repulsion, and in excess of 1:1 salt, (iv) non Coulombic attraction. To efficiently sample configurational space we explore hybrid continuum solvent models, applicable to many-protein systems, where weakly coupled ions are treated implicitly, while strongly coupled ones are treated explicitly. Good agreement is found with the primitive model of electrolytes, as well as with atomic models of protein and  solvent.","Myers, Christopher G., and B. Montgomery Pettitt.

Packing of double-stranded DNA in phages must overcome both electrostatic repulsions and the problem of persistence length. We consider coarse-grained models with the ability to kink and with randomly generated disorder. We show that the introduction of kinking into configurations of the DNA polymer packaged within spherical confinement results in significant reductions of the overall energies and pressures. We use a kink model which has the ability to deform every 24 bp, close to the average length predicted from phage sequence. The introduction of such persistence length defects even with highly random packing models increases the local nematic ordering of the packed DNA polymer segments. Such local ordering allowed by kinking not only reduces the total bending energy of confined DNA due to nonlinear elasticity but also reduces the electrostatic component of the energy and pressure. We show that a broad ensemble of polymer configurations is consistent with the structural data."

Abstract The structures and dynamics of protein complexes are often challenging to model in heterogeneous environments such as biological membranes. Herein, we meet this fundamental challenge at attainable cost with all-atom, mixed-resolution, and coarse-grained models of vital membrane proteins. We systematically simulated five complex models formed by two distinct G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in the lipid-bilayer membrane on the ns-to-µs timescales. These models, which suggest the swinging motion of an intracellular loop, for the first time, provide the molecular details for the regulatory role of such a loop. For the models at different resolution, we observed consistent structural stability but various levels of speed-ups in the protein dynamics. The mixed-resolution and coarsegrained models show two and four times faster protein diffusion than the all-atom models, in addition to a 4- and 400-fold speedup in the simulation performance. Furthermore, by elucidating the strengths and challenges of combining all-atom with reduced resolution models, this study can serve as a guide to simulating other complex systems in heterogeneous environments efficiently.

Abstract Cryo-electron microscopy has become a mainstream structural biology technique by enabling the characterization of biological architectures that for many years have eluded traditional methods like X-ray crystallography and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. However, the translation of cryo-electron microscopy data into accurate structural models is hampered by the presence of random and systematic errors in the data, sample heterogeneity, data correlation, and noise correlation. As a consequence, in integrative biology approaches, it has been difficult to objectively weigh EM-derived restraints with respect to other sources of information. To address these challenges, here we introduce a Bayesian approach that allows efficient and accurate structural modeling of cryo-electron microscopy density maps at multiple scales, from coarse-grained to atomistic resolution. The accuracy of the method is benchmarked using a set of structures of macromolecular assemblies. The approach is implemented in the open-source Integrative Modeling Platform package (http://integrativemodeling.org) in order to enable structural determination by combining cryo-electron microscopy with other information, such as chemical cross-linking/mass spectrometry, NMR, and small angle X-ray scattering data.",,,

Abstract One emerging approach for the fabrication of complex architectures on the nanoscale is to utilize particles customized to intrinsically self-assemble into a desired structure. Inverse methods of statistical mechanics have proven particularly effective for the discovery of interparticle interactions suitable for this aim. Here, we review one such recently introduced inverse design strategy [Lindquist et al.; J. Chem. Phys. 145, 111101 (2016)] and apply the method to realize a variety of self-assembled structures: cluster fluids, porous mesophases, and crystalline lattices. By constraining the functional form of the interaction, we gain new insights into the types of pair potentials that can form such phases. For assembling fluids of monodisperse clusters, we confirm that a broad attractive well in conjunction with a narrow repulsive barrier is superior to the prototypical cluster-forming interaction, i.e.; a very narrow attractive well and a longer-ranged repulsion. Moreover, we discover a purely repulsive potential that results in assembly of a range of microphase-separated states, including a fluid containing spherical zones that exclude particles, i.e.; pores. Finally, we extend the design methodology to use crystalline ""seeds"" to facilitate nucleation of complex crystalline structures in both two and three dimensions.",,,

Abstract Despite more than 40 years of research in condensed-matter physics, state-of-the-art approaches for simulating the radial distribution function (RDF) g(r) still rely on binning pair-separations into a histogram. Such methods suffer from undesirable properties, including subjectivity, high uncertainty, and slow rates of convergence. Moreover, such problems go undetected by the metrics often used to assess RDFs. To address these issues, we propose (I) a spectral Monte Carlo (SMC) quadrature method that yields g(r) as an analytical series expansion and (II) a Sobolev norm that assesses the quality of RDFs by quantifying their fluctuations. Using the latter, we show that, relative to histogram-based approaches, SMC reduces by orders of magnitude both the noise in g(r) and the number of pair separations needed for acceptable convergence. Moreover, SMC reduces subjectivity and yields simple, differentiable formulas for the RDF, which are useful for tasks such as coarse-grained force-field calibration via iterative Boltzmann inversion.

Abstract In this Letter we investigate a direct relationship between a graph’s topology and the free energy of a spin system on the graph. We develop a method of separating topological and energetic contributions to the free energy, and find that considering the topology is sufficient to qualitatively compare the free energies of different graph systems at high temperature, even when the energetics are not fully known. This method was applied to the metal lattice system with defects, and we found that it partially explains why point defects are more stable than high-dimensional defects. Given the energetics, we can even quantitatively compare free energies of different graph structures via a closed form of linear graph contributions. The closed form is applied to predict the sequence-space free energy of lattice proteins, which is a key factor determining the designability of a protein structure.",,,

We propose a data-driven, coarse-graining formulation in the context
of equilibrium statistical mechanics. In contrast to existing
techniques which are based on a fine-to-coarse map, we adopt the
opposite strategy by prescribing a probabilistic coarse-to-fine map.
This corresponds to a directed probabilistic model where the coarse
variables play the role of latent generators of the fine scale
(all-atom) data. From an information-theoretic perspective, the
framework proposed provides an improvement upon the relative entropy
method [1] and is capable of quantifying the uncertainty due to the
information loss that unavoidably takes place during the
coarse-graining process. Furthermore, it can be readily extended to a
fully Bayesian model where various sources of uncertainties are
reflected in the posterior of the model parameters. The latter can be
used to produce not only point estimates of fine-scale reconstructions
or macroscopic observables, but more importantly, predictive posterior
distributions on these quantities. Predictive posterior distributions
reflect the confidence of the model as a function of the amount of
data and the level of coarse-graining. The issues of model complexity
and model selection are seamlessly addressed by employing a
hierarchical prior that favors the discovery of sparse solutions,
revealing the most prominent features in the coarse-grained model. A

Oligomerization of membrane proteins in response to lipid binding has a critical role in many cell-signalling pathways1 but is often difficult to define2 or predict3. Here we report the development of a mass spectrometry platform to determine simultaneously the presence of interfacial lipids and oligomeric stability and to uncover how lipids act as key regulators of membrane-protein association. Evaluation of oligomeric strength for a dataset of 125 α-helical oligomeric membrane proteins reveals an absence of interfacial lipids in the mass spectra of 12 membrane proteins with high oligomeric stability. For the bacterial homologue of the eukaryotic biogenic transporters (LeuT4, one of the proteins with the lowest oligomeric stability), we found a precise cohort of lipids within the dimer interface. Delipidation, mutation of lipid-binding sites or expression in cardiolipin-deficient Escherichia coli abrogated dimer formation. Molecular dynamics simulation revealed that cardiolipin acts as a bidentate ligand, bridging across subunits. Subsequently, we show that for the Vibrio splendidus sugar transporter SemiSWEET5, another protein with low oligomeric stability, cardiolipin shifts the equilibrium from monomer to functional dimer. We hypothesized that lipids are essential for dimerization of the Na+/H+ antiporter NhaA from E. coli, which has the lowest oligomeric strength, but not for the substantially more stable homologous Thermus thermophilus protein NapA. We found that lipid binding is obligatory for dimerization of NhaA, whereas NapA has adapted to form an interface that is stable without lipids. Overall, by correlating interfacial strength with the presence of interfacial lipids, we provide a rationale for understanding the role of lipids in both transient and stable interactions within a range of α-helical membrane proteins, including G-protein-coupled receptors.","C.

Abstract:
A persistent challenge in using the metadynamics method is deciding which degrees of freedom, or collective variables, should be biased because these selections are not obvious and require intuition about the system being studied. There are, however, collective variables, which can be constructed with only basic knowledge about the system studied, that provide an opportunity to alleviate this issue. We simulated two different reacting systems where two types of such collective variables (SPRINT coordinates and the collective variable-driven hyperdynamics method) were biased following the infrequent metadynamics method in order to recover the rates of reactions. We demonstrate that both generic collective variables are capable of reproducing the reaction rates of both systems and can enhance the efficiency of the simulation when compared to typical collective variables.","Title: Estimating the Lipophobic Contributions in Model Membranes

Authors: Vikas Dubey, Xavier Prasanna, and Durba Sengupta

Abstract: The insertion and association of membrane proteins is critical in several cellular processes. These processes were thought to be protein-driven, but increasing evidence points toward an important role of the lipid bilayer. The lipid-mediated contribution has been shown to be important in the association of membrane peptides, but the corresponding “lipophobic” component has not been directly estimated. Here, we calculate the free energy of insertion for transmembrane peptides and estimate the lipophobic component from the cost of cavity formation. The free-energy calculations were performed using the coarse-grain Martini force field, which has been successful in predicting membrane protein interactions. As expected, the charged moieties have the least favorable free energy of insertion and the highest cost of cavity formation. A length dependence was observed in polyalanine peptides with the lipid-mediated component increasing nonlinearly with peptide length. Membrane fluidity was tested by varying the temperature, and opposing effects were observed for short and long peptides. The dependence of the lipid-mediated effects on peptide length and temperature was not uniform and gives valuable insight into the anisotropic nature of the membrane. The results are an important step in estimating membrane effects in protein insertion and association.

Understanding the dynamics of biomolecules is the key to understanding their biological activities. Computational methods ranging from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to coarse-grained normal mode analyses based on simplified elastic networks provide a general framework to studying these dynamics. Despite recent successes in studying very large systems with up to a hundred million atoms, those methods are currently limited to studying small to medium size molecular systems due to computational limitations. One solution to circumvent these limitations is to reduce the size of the system under study. In this paper, we argue that coarse-graining, the standard approach to such size reduction, must define a hierarchy of models of decreasing sizes that are consistent with each other, i.e. that each model contains the information of the dynamics of its predecessor. We propose a new method, Decimate, for generating such a hierarchy within the context of elastic networks for normal mode analysis. This method is based on the concept of the renormalization group developed in statistical physics. We highlight the details of its implementation, with a special focus on its scalability to large systems of up to millions of atoms. We illustrate its application on two large systems, the capsid of a virus and the ribosome translation complex. We show that highly decimated representations of those systems, containing down to 1% of their original number of atoms, still capture qualitatively and quantitatively their dynamics. Decimate is available as an OpenSource resource.","A. B. Poma, M. Ciepiak and P. E.

Abstract:
The application of coarse-grain (CG) models in biology is essential to access large length and time scales required for the description of many biological processes. The ELNEDIN protein model is based on the well-known MARTINI CG force-field and incorporates additionally harmonic bonds of a certain spring constant within a defined cutoff distance between pairs of residues, in order to preserve the native structure of the protein. In this case, the use of unbreakable harmonic bonds hinders the study of unfolded protein structures and unfolding processes. To overcome this barrier we have replaced the harmonic bonds with Lennard--Jones interactions based on the contact map of the native protein structure as is done in Go-like models. This model exhibits very good agreement with all-atom simulations and the ELNEDIN. Moreover, it can capture the structural motion linked to particular catalytic activity in the Man5B protein, in agreement with all-atom simulations. In addition, our model uses a smaller number of additional key ``bonds'', as it is based on the native contact map without any adjustable parameters. In conclusion, we anticipate that our model will provide further possibilities for studying biological systems based on the MARTINI CG force-field by using advanced-sampling methods, such as parallel tempering and metadynamics.","Title: Integrated view of internal friction in unfolded proteins from single-molecule FRET, contact quenching, theory, and simulations

Abstract: Internal friction is an important contribution to protein dynamics at all stages along the folding reaction. Even in unfolded and intrinsically disordered proteins, internal friction has a large influence, as demonstrated with several experimental techniques and in simulations. However, these methods probe different facets of internal friction and have been applied to disparate molecular systems, raising questions regarding the compatibility of the results. To obtain an integrated view, we apply here the combination of two complementary experimental techniques, simulations, and theory to the same system: unfolded protein L. We use single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) to measure the global reconfiguration dynamics of the chain, and photoinduced electron transfer (PET), a contact-based method, to quantify the rate of loop formation between two residues. This combination enables us to probe unfolded-state dynamics on different length scales, corresponding to different parts of the intramolecular distance distribution. Both FRET and PET measurements show that internal friction dominates unfolded-state dynamics at low denaturant concentration, and the results are in remarkable agreement with recent large-scale molecular dynamics simulations using a new water model. The simulations indicate that intrachain interactions and dihedral angle rotation correlate with the presence of internal friction, and theoretical models of polymer dynamics provide a framework for interrelating the contribution of internal friction observed in the two types of experiments and in the simulations. The combined results thus provide a coherent and quantitative picture of internal friction in unfolded proteins that could not be attained from the individual techniques.

Construction of coarse-grained (CG) models for large biomolecules used
for multiscale simulations demands a rigorous definition of CG sites
for them. Several coarse-graining methods such as the simulated
annealing and steepest descent (SASD) based on the essential dynamics
coarse-graining (ED-CG) or the stepwise local iterative optimization
(SLIO) based on the fluctuation maximization coarse-graining (FM-CG),
were developed to do it. However, the practical applications of these
methods such as SASD based on ED-CG are subject to limitations because
of its too expensive. In this work, we extend the applicability of
ED-CG by combining it with SLIO algorithm. A comprehensive comparison
of optimized results and accuracy of SASD, SOBC and SLIO based on
ED-CG show that SLIO is the fastest as well as the most accurate
algorithm among them. ED-CG combined with SLIO could give converged
results as the number of CG sites increases, which demonstrates that
it is another efficient method for coarse-graining large biomolecules.

We show that the three conformational states of integrin α5β1 have discrete free energies and define activation by measuring intrinsic affinities for ligand of each state and the equilibria linking them. The 5,000-fold higher affinity of the extended-open state than the bent-closed and extended-closed states demonstrates profound regulation of affinity. Free energy requirements for activation are defined with protein fragments and intact α5β1. On the surface of K562 cells, α5β1 is 99.8% bent-closed. Stabilization of the bent conformation by integrin transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains must be overcome by cellular energy input to stabilize extension. Following extension, headpiece opening is energetically favored. N-glycans and leg domains in each subunit that connect the ligand-binding head to the membrane repel or crowd one another and regulate conformational equilibria in favor of headpiece opening. The results suggest new principles for regulating signaling in the large class of receptors built from extracellular domains in tandem with single-span transmembrane domains.","M. Li and J. Z.H.

Abstract: 
A recently developed two-bead multipole force field (TMFF) is employed in coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of proteins in combination with polarizable CG water models, the Martini polarizable water model, and modified big multipole water model. Significant improvement in simulated structures and dynamics of proteins is observed in terms of both the root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) of the structures and residue root-mean-square fluctuations (RMSFs) from the native ones in the present simulation compared with the simulation result with Martini’s non-polarizable water model. Our result shows that TMFF simulation using CG water models gives much stable secondary structures of proteins without the need for adding extra interaction potentials to constrain the secondary structures. Our result also shows that by increasing the MD time step from 2 fs to 6 fs, the RMSD and RMSF results are still in excellent agreement with those from all-atom simulations. The current study demonstrated clearly that the application of TMFF together with a polarizable CG water model significantly improves the accuracy and efficiency for CG simulation of proteins.","Title: Structure formation induced by two types of banana-shaped proteins adsorbed on lipid membranes

Authors: Hiroshi Noguchi, and Jean-Baptiste Fournier

Abstract: The assembly of banana-shaped rodlike proteins on membranes, and the associated membrane shape transformations, are investigated by analytical theory and coarse-grained simulations. The membrane-mediated interactions between two banana-shaped inclusions are derived theoretically using a point-like formalism, both for zero surface tension and for finite surface tension. On a larger scale, the interactions between assemblies of such rodlike inclusions are determined analytically. Meshless membrane simulations are performed in the presence of a large number of inclusions of two types, corresponding to rods of opposite curvatures, both for flat membranes and vesicles. Rods of the same type aggregate into linear assemblies perpendicular to the rod axis, leading to membrane tubulation. However, rods of the other type, those of opposite curvature, are attracted to the lateral sides of these assemblies, and stabilize a straight bump structure that prevents tubulation. When the two types of rods have almost opposite curvatures, the bumps attract one another, forming a stripe structure. Positive surface tension is found to stabilize the stripe formation. The simulation results agree well with the theoretical predictions.

Authors: Patrice Koehl, Frédéric Poitevin, Rafael Navazaand, and Marc H. Delarue

Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of biomolecules is the key to understanding their biological activities. Computational methods ranging from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to coarse-grained normal mode analyses based on simplified elastic networks provide a general framework to studying these dynamics. Despite recent successes in studying very large systems with up to a hundred million atoms, those methods are currently limited to studying small to medium size molecular systems due to computational limitations. One solution to circumvent these limitations is to reduce the size of the system under study. In this paper, we argue that coarse-graining, the standard approach to such size reduction, must define a hierarchy of models of decreasing sizes that are consistent with each other, i.e. that each model contains the information of the dynamics of its predecessor. We propose a new method, Decimate, for generating such a hierarchy within the context of elastic networks for normal mode analysis. This method is based on the concept of the renormalization group developed in statistical physics. We highlight the details of its implementation, with a special focus on its scalability to large systems of up to millions of atoms. We illustrate its application on two large systems, the capsid of a virus and the ribosome translation complex. We show that highly decimated representations of those systems, containing down to 1% of their original number of atoms, still capture qualitatively and quantitatively their dynamics.

Abstract:
Heterogeneous nucleation of ice induced by organic materials is of fundamental importance for climate, biology, and industry. Among organic ice-nucleating surfaces, monolayers of long chain alcohols are particularly effective, while monolayers of fatty acids are significantly less so. As these monolayers expose to water hydroxyl groups with an order that resembles the one in the basal plane of ice, it was proposed that lattice matching between ice and the surface controls their ice-nucleating efficiency. Organic monolayers are soft materials and display significant fluctuations. It has been conjectured that these fluctuations assist in the nucleation of ice. Here we use molecular dynamic simulations and laboratory experiments to investigate the relationship between the structure and fluctuations of hydroxylated organic surfaces and the temperature at which they nucleate ice. We find that these surfaces order interfacial water to form domains with ice-like order that are the birthplace of ice. Both mismatch and fluctuations decrease the size of the preordered domains and monotonously decrease the ice freezing temperature. The simulations indicate that fluctuations depress the freezing efficiency of monolayers of alcohols or acids to half the value predicted from lattice mismatch alone. The model captures the experimental trend in freezing efficiencies as a function of chain length and predicts that alcohols have higher freezing efficiency than acids of the same chain length. These trends are mostly controlled by the modulation of the structural mismatch to ice. We use classical nucleation theory to show that the freezing efficiencies of the monolayers are directly related to their free energy of binding to ice. This study provides a general framework to relate the equilibrium thermodynamics of ice binding to a surface and the nonequilibrium ice freezing temperature and suggests that these could be predicted from the structure of interfacial water.","Ward Clustering Improves Cross-Validated Markov State Models of Protein Folding

Markov state models (MSMs) are a powerful framework for analyzing protein dynamics. MSMs require the decomposition of conformation space into states via clustering, which can be cross-validated when a prediction method is available for the clustering method. We present an algorithm for predicting cluster assignments of new data points with Ward’s minimum variance method. We then show that clustering with Ward’s method produces better or equivalent cross-validated MSMs for protein folding than other clustering algorithms.

Authors: Michael D. Ward, Shivangi Nangia, and Eric R. May

Abstract: The PACE force field presents an attractive model for conducting molecular dynamics simulations of membrane-protein systems. PACE is a hybrid model, in which lipids and solvents are coarse-grained consistent with the MARTINI mapping, while proteins are described by a united atom model. However, given PACE is linked to MARTINI, which is widely used to study membranes, the behavior of proteins interacting with membranes has only been limitedly examined in PACE. In this study, PACE is used to examine the behavior of several peptides in membrane environments, namely WALP peptides, melittin and influenza hemagglutinin fusion peptide (HAfp). Overall, we find PACE provides an improvement over MARTINI for modeling helical peptides, based on the membrane insertion energetics for WALP16 and more realistic melittin pore dynamics. Our studies on HAfp, which forms a helical hairpin structure, do not show the hairpin structure to be stable, which may point toward a deficiency in the model.

The application of coarse-grain (CG) models in biology is essential to
access large length and time scales required for the description of
many biological processes. The ELNEDIN protein model is based on the
well-known MARTINI CG force-field and incorporates additionally
harmonic bonds of a certain spring constant within a defined cutoff
distance between pairs of residues, in order to preserve the native
structure of the protein. In this case, the use of unbreakable
harmonic bonds hinders the study of unfolded protein structures and
unfolding processes. To overcome this barrier we have replaced the
harmonic bonds with Lennard--Jones interactions based on the contact
map of the native protein structure as is done in Go-like models. This
model exhibits very good agreement with all-atom simulations and the
ELNEDIN. Moreover, it can capture the structural motion linked to
particular catalytic activity in the Man5B protein, in agreement with
all-atom simulations. In addition, our model uses a smaller number of
additional key ``bonds'', as it is based on the native contact map
without any adjustable parameters. In conclusion, we anticipate that
our model will provide further possibilities for studying biological
systems based on the MARTINI CG force-field by using advanced-sampling
methods, such as parallel tempering and metadynamics.","Coarse-grained simulations of cis- and trans-polybutadiene: A bottom-up approach

We apply the dissipative particle dynamics strategy proposed by Hijón et al.[Faraday Discuss. 144, 301–322 (2010)] and based on an exact derivation of the generalized Langevin equation to cis- and trans-1,4-polybutadiene. We prove that it is able to reproduce not only the structural but also the dynamical properties of these polymers without any fitting parameter. A systematic study of the effect of the level of coarse-graining is done on cis-1,4-polybutadiene. We show that as the level of coarse-graining increases, the dynamical properties are better and better reproduced while the structural properties deviate more and more from those calculated in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We suggest two reasons for this behavior: the Markovian approximation is better satisfied as the level of coarse-graining increases, while the pair-wise approximation neglects important contributions due to the relative orientation of the beads at large levels of coarse-graining. Finally, we highlight a possible limit of the Markovian approximation: the fact that in constrained simulations, in which the centers-of-mass of the beads are kept constant, the bead rotational dynamics become extremely slow.",

DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpca.6b10337
Biological systems have been shown to shuttle excess protons long distances by taking advantage of tightly organized hydrogen-bonded water bridges in hydrophobic protein cavities, and similar effects have been observed in carbon nanotubes. In this theoretical study we investigate how quantum effects of proton motion impact the rate constants for charge transfer in a model system consisting of a donor and acceptor molecule separated by a single-molecule water bridge. We calculate quantum and classical rate constants for the transfer of an excess proton over two possible paths, one with an H3O+ intermediate, and one with an OH– intermediate. Quantum effects are included through ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) calculations. We observe a 4-fold enhancement of reaction rate constants due to proton tunneling at temperatures between 280 and 320 K, as shown by transmission coefficient calculations. Deuteration of the donor and acceptor proton are shown to decrease the reaction rate constant by a factor of 50, and this is another indicator that tunneling plays an important role in this proton transfer mechanism.","Title: Toward Hydrodynamics with Solvent Free Lipid Models: STRD Martini

Authors: Andrew Zgorski and Edward Lyman

Abstract: Solvent hydrodynamics are incorporated into simulations of the solvent-free Dry Martini model. The solvent hydrodynamics are modeled with the stochastic rotation dynamics (SRD) algorithm, a particle-based method for resolving fluid hydrodynamics. SRD does not require calculation of particle-particle distances in the solvent, and so is scalable to arbitrary volumes of solvent with minimal additional computational overhead. The viscosity of the solvent is easily tuned via parameters of the algorithm to span an order of magnitude in viscosity around the viscosity of water at room temperature. The combination “Stochastic Thermostatted Rotation Dynamics (STRD) with Martini” was implemented in Gromacs v.5.01. Simulations of an SRD/palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine membrane demonstrate that the solvent may be included without reparametrizing the lipid model, with minimal perturbation to the thermodynamics. A recent generalization of Saffman-Delbruck theory to periodic geometries by Camley and Brown indicates that lipid dynamics are contaminated by a finite-size effect in typical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and that very large systems are required for quantitative simulation of dynamics. Analysis of lipid translational diffusion in this work shows good agreement with the theory, and with explicitly solvated simulations. This indicates that STRD Martini is a viable approach for quantitative simulation of membrane dynamics and does not require massive computational overhead to model the solvent.

While global order parameters have widely been used, as reaction
coordinates, in nucleation and crystallization studies, their use in
nucleation studies is claimed to have a serious drawback. In this
work, a local order parameter is introduced, as a local reaction
coordinate, to drive the simulation from the liquid to solid phase and
vice versa. This local order parameter holds information regarding the
order in the first and the second shell neighbors of a particle and
has different well-defined values for local crystallites and
disordered neighborhoods, but is insensitive to the type of the
crystal structure. The order parameter is employed in metadynamics
simulations to calculate the solid-liquid phase equilibria and free
energy barrier to nucleation. Our results for the repulsive soft
spheres and the Lennard-Jones, LJ(12-6), potential reveal better
resolved solid and liquid basins (compared to the case in which a
global order parameter is used). It is also shown that in the present
method, the configuration space is sampled more efficiently, allowing
a more accurate calculation of free energy barrier and the
solid-liquid interfacial free energy. Another feature of the present
local-order-parameter based method is that it is possible to apply the
bias potential to regions of interest on the order parameter space,
for example on the largest nucleus in the case of nucleation studies.
In the present scheme for metadynamics simulation of the nucleation in
supercooled LJ(12-6) particles, unlike the cases in which the global
order parameters are employed, there is no need to have an estimate of
the size of the critical nucleus and to refine the results with the
results of umbrella sampling simulations. The barrier heights and the
nucleation pathway, obtained from this method, agree very well with
former umbrella sampling simulations results.","
Predicting low-temperature free energy landscapes with flat-histogram Monte Carlo methods
Nathan A. Mahynski 1, Marco A. Blanco 1, Jeffrey R. Errington 2, and Vincent K. Shen The Journal of Chemical Physics 2017 146:7
We present a method for predicting the free energy landscape of fluids at low temperatures from flat-histogram grand canonical Monte Carlo simulationsperformed at higher ones. We illustrate our approach for both pure and multicomponent systems using two different sampling methods as a demonstration. This allows us to predict the thermodynamic behavior of systems which undergo both first order and continuous phase transitions upon cooling using simulations performed only at higher temperatures. After surveying a variety of different systems, we identify a range of temperature differences over which the extrapolation of high temperature simulations tends to quantitatively predict the thermodynamic properties of fluids at lower ones. Beyond this range, extrapolation still provides a reasonably well-informed estimate of the free energy landscape; this prediction then requires less computational effort to refine with an additional simulation at the desired temperature than reconstruction of the surface without any initial estimate. In either case, this method significantly increases the computational efficiency of these flat-histogram methods when investigating thermodynamic properties of fluids over a wide range of temperatures. For example, we demonstrate how a binary fluid phase diagram may be quantitatively predicted for many temperatures using only information obtained from a single supercritical state.",
"Markov State Models from short non-Equilibrium Simulations - Analysis and Correction of Estimation Bias
Nuske, et al.
Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability. arXiv:1701.01665 [physics.data-an] Many state of the art methods for the thermodynamic and kinetic characterization of large and complex biomolecular systems by simulation rely on ensemble approaches, where data from large numbers of relatively short trajectories are integrated. In this context, Markov state models (MSMs) are extremely popular because they can be used to compute stationary quantities and long-time kinetics from ensembles of short simulations, provided that these short simulations are in “local equilibrium” within the MSM states. However, in the last over 15 years since the inception of MSMs, it has been controversially discussed and not yet been answered how deviations from local equilibrium can be detected, whether these deviations induce a practical bias in MSM estimation, and how to correct for them. In this paper, we address these issues: We systematically analyze the estimation of Markov state models (MSMs) from short non-equilibrium simulations, and we provide an expression for the error between unbiased transition probabilities and the expected estimate from many short simulations. We show that the unbiased MSM estimate can be obtained even from relatively short non-equilibrium simulations in the limit of long lag times and good discretization. Further, we exploit observable operator model (OOM) theory to derive an unbiased estimator for the MSM transition matrix that corrects for the effect of starting out of equilibrium, even when short lag times are used. Finally, we show how the OOM framework can be used to estimate the exact eigenvalues or relaxation timescales of the system without estimating an MSM transition matrix, which allows us to practically assess the discretization quality of the MSM. Applications to model systems and molecular dynamics simulation data of alanine dipeptide are included for illustration. The improved MSM estimator is implemented in PyEMMA as of version 2.3.","title: Variational Koopman models: slow collective variables and

molecular kinetics from short off-equilibrium simulations

journal: arXiv:1610.06773v2 [stat.ML]

abstract: Markov state models (MSMs) and Master equation models are popular approaches to approximate molecular kinetics, equilibria, metastable states, and reaction coordinates in terms of a state space discretization usually obtained by clustering. Recently, a powerful generalization of MSMs has been introduced, the variational approach (VA) of molecular kinetics and its special case the time-lagged independent component analysis (TICA), which allow us to approximate slow collective variables and molecular kinetics by linear combinations of smooth basis functions or orderparameters. While it is known how to estimate MSMs from trajectories whose starting points are not sampled from an equilibrium ensemble, this has not yet been the case for TICA and the VA. Previous estimates from short trajectories, have been strongly biased and thus not variationally optimal. Here, we employ Koopman operator theory and ideas from dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) to extend the VA and TICA to non-equilibrium data. The main insight is that the VA and TICA provide a coefficient matrix that we call Koopman model, as it approximates the underlying dynamical (Koopman) operator in conjunction with the basis set used. This Koopman model can be used to compute a stationary vector to reweight the data to equilibrium. From such a Koopman-reweighted sample, equilibrium expectation values and variationally optimal reversible Koopman models can be constructed even with short simulations. The Koopman model can be used to propagate densities, and its eigenvalue decomposition provide estimates of relaxation timescales and slow collective variables for dimension reduction. Koopman models are generalizations of Markov state models, TICA and the linear VA and allow molecular kinetics to be described without a cluster discretization.","D Nocito and GJO Beran, ""Averaged Condensed Phase Model for

parameters. The model captures detailed heterogeneous features in the
environment that may be difficult to describe using a conventional

calculations for each new configuration of the environment, the ACPE
approach allows one to perform a single QM calculation on an averaged
configuration. Here, we demonstrate the model by computing electronic
excitation energies for several small molecules in solution. The ACPE
model predicts the excitation energies in excellent agreement with
conventional configurational averaging yet with orders of magnitude of
reduction in the computational cost.","Efficient stochastic simulation of biochemical reactions with noise and delays

The stochastic simulation algorithm has been used to generate exact trajectories of biochemical reaction networks. For each simulation step, the simulation selects a reaction and its firing time according to a probability that is proportional to the reaction propensity. We investigate in this paper new efficient formulations of the stochastic simulation algorithm to improve its computational efficiency. We examine the selection of the next reaction firing and reduce its computational cost by reusing the computation in the previous step. For biochemical reactions with delays, we present a new method forcomputing the firing time of the next reaction. The principle for computing the firing time of our approach is based on recycling of random numbers. Our new approach for generating the firing time of the next reaction is not only computationally efficient but also easy to implement. We further analyze and reduce the number of propensity updates when a delayed reaction occurred. We demonstrate the applicability of our improvements by experimenting with concrete biological models.

abstract: We present a refined version of the polarizable Martini water model – coined refPOL – designed specifically for the use with long-range electrostatics. The refPOL model improves the agreement with the experimentally measured dielectric constant and the mass density of water at room temperature compared to the original polarizable Martini water force field when particle mesh Ewald electrostatics are employed. Our study reveals that the model remains applicable with various commonly used settings for the non-bonded interactions, including reaction field electrostatics. The oil/water partitioning behavior of uncharged Martini bead types is thoroughly investigated: Lennard-Jones interactions between the refPOL model and the remaining Martini beads are adjusted to reproduce the hydration free energies obtained with the original polarizable water model, while free energies of solvation in apolar media remain unchanged. The cross-interactions with charged bead types are parameterized to agree with the experimentally observed area per lipid of a fully solvated dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine bilayer. We additionally verify the model by analyzing the potentials of mean force between different sample pairs in refPOL water and comparing the results to reference data obtained using the original polarizable Martini water model as well as fully atomistic simulations. Based on the results, we suggest to replace the original polarizable Martini water model with the new refPOL model for future applications.","JZH Zhang, M Li, and JZH Zhang, ""Two-bead Polarizable Water Models

Finally, we highlight a possible limit of the Markovian approximation: the fact that in constrained simulations, in which the centers-of-mass of the beads are kept constant, the bead rotational dynamics become extremely slow.",

Construction of coarse-grained (CG) models for large biomolecules used for multiscale simulations demands a rigorous definition of CG sites for them. Several coarse-graining methods such as the simulated annealing and steepest descent (SASD) based on the essential dynamics coarse-graining (ED-CG) or the stepwise local iterative optimization (SLIO) based on the fluctuation maximization coarse-graining (FM-CG), were developed to do it. However, the practical applications of these methods such as SASD based on ED-CG are subject to limitations because of its too expensive. In this work, we extend the applicability of ED-CG by combining it with SLIO algorithm. A comprehensive comparison of optimized results and accuracy of SASD, SOBC and SLIO based on ED-CG show that SLIO is the fastest as well as the most accurate algorithm among them. ED-CG combined with SLIO could give converged results as the number of CG sites increases, which demonstrates that it is another efficient method for coarse-graining large biomolecules. The construction of CG sites for Ras protein by using MD fluctuations demonstrates that the CG sites derived from FM-CG can reflect the fluctuation properties of secondary structures in Ras accurately.","title: Voltage Gating of a Biomimetic Nanopore: Electrowetting of a Hydrophobic Barrier

journal: ACS Nano, Article ASAP. DOI: 10.1021/acsnano.6b07865

abstract: It is desirable that nanopores that are components of biosensors are gated, i.e., capable of controllable switching between closed (impermeable) and open (permeable) states. A central hydrophobic barrier within a nanopore may act as a voltage-dependent gate via electrowetting, i.e., changes in nanopore surface wettability by application of an electric field. We use “computational electrophysiology” simulations to demonstrate and characterize electrowetting of a biomimetic nanopore containing a hydrophobic gate. We show that a hydrophobic gate in a model β-barrel nanopore can be functionally opened by electrowetting at voltages that do not electroporate lipid bilayers. During the process of electrowetting, voltage-induced alignment of water dipoles occurs within the hydrophobic gate region of the nanopore, with water entry preceding permeation of ions through the opened nanopore. When the ionic imbalance that generates a transbilayer potential is dissipated, water is expelled from the hydrophobic gate and the nanopore recloses. The open nanopore formed by electrowetting of a “featureless” β-barrel is anionic selective due to the transmembrane dipole potential resulting from binding of Na+ ions to the headgroup regions of the surrounding lipid bilayer. Thus, hydrophobic barriers can provide voltage-dependent gates in designed biomimetic nanopores. This extends our understanding of hydrophobic gating in synthetic and biological nanopores, providing a framework for the design of functional nanopores with tailored gating functionality.","The renormalization group and its applications to generating coarse-grained models of large biological molecular systems

Understanding the dynamics of biomolecules is the key to understanding their biological activities. Computational methods ranging from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to coarse-grained normal mode analyses based on simplified elastic networks provide a general framework to studying these dynamics. Despite recent successes in studying very large systems with up to a hundred million atoms, those methods are currently limited to studying small to medium size molecular systems due to computational limitations. One solution to circumvent these limitations is to reduce the size of the system under study. In this paper, we argue that coarse-graining, the standard approach to such size reduction, must define a hierarchy of models of decreasing sizes that are consistent with each other, i.e. that each model contains the information of the dynamics of its predecessor. We propose a new method, Decimate, for generating such a hierarchy within the context of elastic networks for normal mode analysis. This method is based on the concept of the renormalization group developed in statistical physics. We highlight the details of its implementation, with a special focus on its scalability to large systems of up to millions of atoms. We illustrate its application on two large systems, the capsid of a virus and the ribosome translation complex. We show that highly decimated representations of those systems, containing down to 1% of their original number of atoms, still capture qualitatively and quantitatively their dynamics. Decimate is available as an OpenSource resource.","title: Exploring the Complex Dynamics of an Ion Channel Voltage Sensor Domain via Computation

abstract: Voltage-gated ion channels are ubiquitous proteins that orchestrate electrical signaling across excitable membranes. Key to their function is activation of the voltage sensor domain (VSD), a transmembrane four alpha-helix bundle that triggers channel opening. Modeling of currents from electrophysiology experiments yields a set of kinetic parameters for a given channel, but no direct molecular insight. Here we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to determine the free energy landscape of VSD activation and to, ultimately, predict the time evolution of the resulting gating currents. Our study provides the long-sought-for bridge between electrophysiology and microscopic molecular dynamics and confirms, as already suggested on the basis of experiments, that rate-limiting barriers play a critical role in activation kinetics.",

The Journal of Physical Chemistry B Just Accepted Manuscript
DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b10836

Line tension (γ) is a key parameter for the structure and dynamics of membrane domains. It was proposed that hybrid lipids, with mixed saturated and unsaturated acyl chains, participate in the relaxation of γ through different mechanisms. In this work we used molecular-dynamics simulations of the coarse-grained MARTINI model to measure γ in liquid ordered-liquid disordered (Lo-Ld) membranes increasingly enriched in the relative proportion of the hybrid polyunsaturated lipid PAPC (4:0-5:4PC), to DAPC (di5:4PC) (ie. XH). We also calculated an elastic contribution to γ by the Lo-Ld thickness mismatch, tilt moduli and bending moduli, as predicted by theory. We found that an increase in XH decreased the overall γ value and the elastic contribution to line tension. The effect on the elastic line tension is driven by a reduced hydrophobic mismatch. Changes in the phases' elastic constants due to an increase in XHproduced a slightly larger elastic γ term. In addition to this elastic energy, other major contributions to γ are found in these model membranes. Increasing XH decreases both the elastic and non-elastic contributions to γ. Finally, PAPC also behaves as a linactant, relaxing γ through an interfacial effect as predicted by theoretical results. This study gives insight into the actual contribution of distinct energy terms to γ in bilayers containing polyunsaturated hybrid lipids.","A Discrete Molecular Dynamics Approach to the Study of Disordered and Aggregating Proteins

The PACSAB/DMD method also reproduces accurately aggregation properties, providing good pictures of the structural ensembles of proteins showing a folded core and an intrinsically disordered region.

PHAST is a software package written in standard Fortran, with MPI and CUDA extensions, able to efficiently perform parallel multicanonical Monte Carlo simulations of single or multiple heteropolymeric chains, as coarse-grained models for proteins. The outcome data can be straightforwardly analyzed within its microcanonical Statistical Thermodynamics module, which allows for computing the entropy, caloric curve, specific heat and free energies. As a case study, we investigate the aggregation of heteropolymers bioinspired on Aβ25−33 fragments and their cross-seeding with IAPP20−29 isoforms. Excellent parallel scaling is observed, even under numerically difficult first-order like phase transitions, which are properly described by the built-in fully reconfigurable force fields. Still, the package is free and open source, this shall motivate users to readily adapt it to specific purposes.","title: Modeling protein conformational transition pathways using collective motions and the LASSO method

authors: Hayes TW, Moal IH.

abstract: Many proteins can adopt multiple distinct conformational states which often play different functional roles. Previous studies have shown that the underlying global dynamics through which these states are accessed are, at least in part, encoded by the protein's topology. In this work we present a method for generating transition pathways between states by perturbing the protein towards a target conformational state along thermally accessible collective motions calculated from the starting conformation. Specifically, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) is used to identify the most parsimonious route along soft modes calculated using the anisotropic network model. In a survey of 436 conformational changes following protein-protein interaction, we show that such a path exists for most cases and that selected paths are low in energy. We discuss the implications for the atomic modelling of protein recognition, and provide soft energy and parameter bounds which can be employed to efficiently constrain the sampling of such pathways",

We present a revised version of a coarse-grained model for RNA dynamics. In such approach, the description of nucleotides is reduced to single points that interact between them through a series of effective pair potentials that were obtained from an improved analysis of RNA structures from the Protein Data Bank. These interaction potentials are the main constituents of a Brownian dynamics simulation algorithm that allows to perform a variety of tasks by taking advantage of the reduced number of variables. Such tasks include the prediction of the three-dimensional configuration of a series of test molecules. Moreover, the model permits the inclusion of effective magnesium ions and the ends of the RNA chains can be pulled with an external force to study the process of unfolding. In spite of the simplicity of the model, we obtain a good agreement with the experimental results.","Transferable Reactive Force Fields: Extensions of ReaxFF-lg to Nitromethane

Transferable ReaxFF-lg models of nitromethane that predict a variety of material properties over a wide range of thermodynamic states are obtained by screening a library of ~6600 potentials that were previously optimized through the Multiple Objective Evolutionary Strategies (MOES) approach using a training set that included information for other energetic materials composed of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen. Models that best match experimental nitromethane lattice constants at 4.2 K, 1 atm are evaluated for transferability to high pressure states at room temperature and are shown to better predict various liquid and solid-phase structural, thermodynamic and transport properties as compared to the existing ReaxFF and ReaxFF-lg nitromethane parameterizations. Although demonstrated for an energetic material, the library of ReaxFF-lg models are supplied to the scientific community to enable new research explorations of complex reactive phenomena in a variety of materials research applications.","Perilla, J. R., Zhao, G., Lu, M., Ning, J., Hou, G., Byeon, I. L., ... & Zhang, P. (2017). CryoEM Structure Refinement by Integrating NMR Chemical Shifts with Molecular Dynamics Simulations. The journal of physical chemistry. B.

Single particle cryoEM has emerged as a powerful method for structure determination of proteins and complexes, complementing X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. Yet, for many systems, the resolution of cryoEM density map has been limited to 4-6 Å, which only allows for resolving bulky amino acids side chains, thus hindering accurate model building from the density map. On the other hand, experimental chemical shifts (CS) from solution and solid state MAS NMR spectra provide atomic level data for each amino acid within a molecule or a complex; however, structure determination of large complexes and assemblies based on NMR data alone remains challenging. Here we present a novel integrated strategy to combine the highly complementary experimental data from cryoEM and NMR computationally by molecular dynamics simulations to derive an atomistic model, which is not attainable by either approach alone. We use the HIV-1 capsid protein (CA) C-terminal domain as well as the large capsid assembly to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, termed NMR CS-biased cryoEM structure refinement.","Title: Coarse-grained simulations of cis- and trans-polybutadiene: A bottom-up approach

Abstract We apply the dissipative particle dynamics strategy proposed by Hijón et al.

We prove that it is able to reproduce not only the structural but also the dynamical properties of these polymers without any fitting parameter. A systematic study of the effect of the level of coarse-graining is done on cis-1,4-polybutadiene. We show that as the level of coarse-graining increases, the dynamical properties are better and better reproduced while the structural properties deviate more and more from those calculated in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We suggest two reasons for this behavior: the Markovian approximation is better satisfied as the level of coarse-graining increases, while the pair-wise approximation neglects important contributions due to the relative orientation of the beads at large levels of coarse-graining.

Biomacromolecules Just Accepted Manuscript
DOI: 10.1021/acs.biomac.6b01674

In this work, the interactions between block copolymer micelles (BCMs) and plasma membranes were investigated by performing coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations. Different binding strengths between the BCMs and the membranes were tested, and four interaction pathways were discovered: attachment, semi-endocytosis, endocytosis, and fusion. Endocytosis was the most efficient way for the BCMs to be taken up, and fusion could lead to cytotoxicity. Unlike rigid particles, deformation of the BCMs strongly affected the interaction pathways. We examined the effects of changing the aggregation number of the BCMs (Nagg), the chain length of the polymer (Nb), and the chain stiffness of the hydrophobic block (ka), and we learned that smaller Nagg and lower Nb could lead to weaker cellular uptake capacities, whereas larger Nagg and higher Nb gave rise to higher cytotoxicities. Moreover, a weaker chain stiffness of the hydrophobic block could be more favorable for obtaining BCMs with higher internalization efficacies and lower cytotoxicities. The results of these simulations could aid in the design of BCMs with desirable cellular internalization capacities and lower cytotoxicities. Such BCMs could be useful in drug delivery systems.","Effect of Chain Length on the Partition Properties of Poly(ethylene Oxide): A Comparison Between MARTINI Coarse-Grained and Atomistic Models

The MARTINI coarse-graining beads are parameterised to match the partition coefficients of several organic molecules in different solvents. Here we test the method when modelling the partitioning properties of polyethylene oxide between solvents of different polarity. We show that, between the existing models, the latest model developed by Lee and coworkers11 is the one that most successfully reproduces the hydration free energy of short oligomers, although it predicts highly negative solvation free energies in octanol and hexane. We develop a new CG model matching the solvation free energy of the monomer in different solvents and propose a simple method to select the Lennard-Jones parameters that reproduce the desired partition coefficients. The model correctly reproduces water/hexane partition properties for oligomers up to 10 monomers but still suffers from a transferability problem for larger molecular weight.","Lorenz, Chris, and Nikos L.

Abstract Peptide Nucleic Acids (PNAs) can efficiently target DNA or RNA acting as chemical tools for gene regulation. Their backbone modification and functionalization is often used to increase the affinity for a particular sequence improving selectivity. The understanding of the trading forces that lead the single strand PNA to bind the DNA or RNA sequence is preparatory for any further rational design, but a clear and unique description of this process is still not complete. In this paper we report further insights into this subject, by a computational investigation aiming at the characterization of the conformations of a single strand PNA and how these can be correlated to its capability in binding DNA/RNA. Employing Metadynamics we were able to better define conformational pre-organizations of the single strand PNA and γ-modified PNA otherwise unrevealed through classical molecular dynamics. Our simulations driven on backbone modified PNAs lead to the conclusion that this γ-functionalization affects the single strand preorganization and targeting properties to the DNA/RNA, in agreement with circular dichroism (CD) spectra obtained for this class of compounds. MD simulations on PNA:RNA dissociation and association mechanisms allowed to reveal the critical role of central bases and preorganization in the binding process.",

Abstract:
We present a refined version of the polarizable Martini water model – coined refPOL – designed specifically for the use with long-range electrostatics. The refPOL model improves the agreement with the experimentally measured dielectric constant and the mass density of water at room temperature compared to the original polarizable Martini water force field when particle mesh Ewald electrostat- ics are employed. Our study reveals that the model remains applicable with various commonly used settings for the non-bonded interactions, including reaction field electrostatics. The oil/water partition- ing behavior of uncharged Martini bead types is thoroughly investigated: Lennard-Jones interactions between the refPOL model and the remaining Martini beads are adjusted to reproduce the hydration free energies obtained with the original polarizable water model, while free energies of solvation in apolar media remain unchanged. The cross-interactions with charged bead types are parameterized to agree with the experimentally observed area per lipid of a fully solvated dipalmitoylphosphatidyl- choline bilayer. We additionally verify the model by analyzing the potentials of mean force between different sample pairs in refPOL water and comparing the results to reference data obtained using the original polarizable Martini water model as well as fully atomistic simulations. Based on the results, we suggest to replace the original polarizable Martini water model with the new refPOL model for future applications.","Automatic Reaction Pathway Search via Combined Molecular Dynamics and Coordinate Driving Method

We proposed and implemented a combined molecular dynamics and coordinate driving (MD/CD) method for automatically searching multistep reaction pathways of chemical reactions. In this approach, the molecular dynamic (MD) method at the molecular mechanics (MM) or semiempirical quantum mechanical (QM) level is employed to explore the conformational space of the minimum structures, and the modified coordinate driving (CD) method is used to build reaction pathways for representative conformers. The MD/CD method is first applied to two model reactions (the Claisen rearrangement and the intermolecular aldol reaction). By comparing the obtained results with those of the existing methods, we found that the MD/CD method has a comparable performance in searching low-energy reaction pathways. Then, the MD/CD method is further applied to investigate two reactions: the electrocyclic reaction of benzocyclobutene-7-carboxaldehyde and the intramolecular Diels–Alder reaction of ketothioester with 11 effectively rotatable single bonds. For the first reaction, our results can correctly account for its torquoselectivity. For the second one, our method predicts eight reaction channels, leading to eight different stereo- and regioselective products. The MD/CD method is expected to become an efficient and cost-effective theoretical tool for automatically searching low-energy reaction pathways for relatively complex chemical reactions.","Systematic Quantum Mechanical Region Determination in QM/MM Simulation

DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.6b01049

Hybrid quantum mechanical-molecular mechanical (QM/MM) simulations are widely used in enzyme simulation. Over ten convergence studies of QM/MM methods have revealed over the past several years that key energetic and structural properties approach asymptotic limits with only very large (ca. 500–1000 atom) QM regions. This slow convergence has been observed to be due in part to significant charge transfer between the core active site and the surrounding protein environment, which cannot be addressed by improvement of MM force fields or the embedding method employed within QM/MM. Given this slow convergence, it becomes essential to identify strategies for the most atom-economical determination of optimal QM regions and to gain insight into the crucial interactions captured only in large QM regions. Here, we extend and develop two methods for quantitative determination of QM regions. First, in the charge shift analysis (CSA) method, we probe the reorganization of electron density when core active site residues are removed completely, as determined by large-QM region QM/MM calculations. Second, we introduce the highly parallelizable Fukui shift analysis (FSA), which identifies how core/substrate frontier states are altered by the presence of an additional QM residue in smaller initial QM regions. We demonstrate that the FSA and CSA approaches are complementary and consistent on three test case enzymes: catechol O-methyltransferase, cytochrome P450cam, and hen eggwhite lysozyme. We also introduce validation strategies and test the sensitivities of the two methods to geometric structure, basis set size, and electronic structure methodology. Both methods represent promising approaches for the systematic, unbiased determination of quantum mechanical effects in enzymes and large systems that necessitate multiscale modeling.

DOI: arXiv:1702.05203.

Abstract Determining the solvation free energies of single ions in water is one of the most fundamental problems in physical chemistry and yet many unresolved questions remain. In particular, the ability to decompose the solvation free energy into simple and intuitive contributions will have important implications for coarse grained models of electrolyte solution. Here, we provide rigorous definitions of the various types of single ion solvation free energies based on different simulation protocols. We calculate solvation free energies of charged hard spheres using density functional theory interaction potentials with molecular dynamics simulation (DFT-MD) and isolate the effects of charge and cavitation, comparing to the Born (linear response) model. We show that using uncorrected Ewald summation leads to highly unphysical values for the solvation free energy and that charging free energies for cations are approximately linear as a function of charge but that there is a small non-linearity for small anions. The charge hydration asymmetry (CHA) for hard spheres, determined with quantum mechanics, is much larger than for the analogous real ions. This suggests that real ions, particularly anions, are significantly more complex than simple charged hard spheres, a commonly employed representation. ",

Abstract:

Reaction coordinates are widely used throughout chemical physics to model and understand com- plex chemical transformations. We introduce a definition of the natural reaction coordinate, suitable for condensed phase and biomolecular systems, as a maximally predictive one-dimensional pro- jection. We then show that this criterion is uniquely satisfied by a dominant eigenfunction of an integral operator associated with the ensemble dynamics. We present a new sparse estimator for these eigenfunctions which can search through a large candidate pool of structural order parame- ters and build simple, interpretable approximations that employ only a small number of these order parameters. Example applications with a small molecule’s rotational dynamics and simulations of protein conformational change and folding show that this approach can filter through statistical noise to identify simple reaction coordinates from complex dynamics.","Comparing van der Waals DFT methods for water on NaCl(001) and MgO(001)

In this work, a range of van der Waals type density functionals are applied to the H2O/NaCl(001) and H2O/MgO(001) interface systems to explore the effect of an explicit dispersion treatment. The functionals we use are the self-consistent vdW functionals vdW-DF, vdW-DF2, optPBE-vdW, optB88-vdW, optB86b-vdW, and vdW-DF-cx, as well as the dispersion-corrected PBE-TS and PBE-D2 methods; they are all compared with the standard PBE functional. For both NaCl(001) and MgO(001), we find that the dispersion-flavoured functionals stabilize the water-surface interface by approximately 20%-40% compared to the PBE results. For NaCl(001), where the water molecules remain intact for all overlayers, the dominant contribution to the adsorption energy from “density functional theory dispersion” stems from the water-surface interactions rather than the water-water interactions. The optPBE-vdW and vdW-DF-cx functionals yield adsorption energies in good agreement with available experimental values for both NaCl and MgO. To probe the strengths of the perturbations of the adsorbed water molecules, we also calculated water dipole moments and found an increase up to 85% for water at the MgO(001) surface and 70% at the NaCl(001) surface, compared to the gas-phase dipole moment.","Comparing Hydroxide and Hydronium at the Instantaneous Air-Water Interface Using Polarizable Multi-State Empirical Valence Bond Models

A new molecular model for the hydroxide anion was developed and its propensity for the air-water interface was compared with that of the hydronium ion. The multi-state empirical valence bond approach with polarizable potentials was used for both of these, allowing them to share their charge with adjacent water molecules. The hydroxide anion appeared to have a lower propensity for the air-water interface than that of hydronium when comparing its potential of mean force with respect to the Gibbs dividing surface. However, upon further inspection it was found that the hydroxide and hydronium ions had similar free energies at the instantaneous air-water interface. The reason for this discrepancy is that the hydroxide anion has a greater free energy when it was partially solvated. Or in other words, when the hydroxide anion is one molecular layer from the instantaneous air-water interface, but potentially still near the Gibbs dividing surface, it is less stable than the hydronium in a similar configuration. This shows that using the instantaneous interface can provide additional important insights.","Title: Assessing Generic Collective Variables for Determining Reaction Rates in Metadynamics Simulations

Abstract A persistent challenge in using the metadynamics method is deciding which degrees of freedom, or collective variables, should be biased because these selections are not obvious and require intuition about the system being studied. There are, however, collective variables, which can be constructed with only basic knowledge about the system studied, that provide an opportunity to alleviate this issue. We simulated two different reacting systems where two types of such collective variables (SPRINT coordinates and the collective variable-driven hyperdynamics method) were biased following the infrequent metadynamics method in order to recover the rates of reactions. We demonstrate that both generic collective variables are capable of reproducing the reaction rates of both systems and can enhance the efficiency of the simulation when compared to typical collective variables.",

Abstract:

Water is a highly polar solvent. As a result, electrostatic interactions of interfacial water molecules play a dominant role in determining the distribution of ions in electric double layers (EDLs). Near a surface, an inhomogeneous and anisotropic arrangement of water molecules gives rise to pronounced variations in the electrostatic and hydration energies of ions. Therefore, a detailed description of the structural and dielectric properties of water is important to study EDLs. However, most theoretical models ignore the molecular effects of water and treat water as a background continuum with a uniform dielectric permittivity. Explicit consideration of water polarization and hydration of ions is both theoretically and numerically challenging. In this work, we present an empirical potential-based quasi-continuum theory (EQT) for EDL, which incorporates the polarization and hydration effects of water explicitly. In EQT, water molecules are modeled as Langevin point dipoles and a point dipole based coarse-grained model for water is developed systematically. The space dependence of the dielec- tric permittivity of water is included in the Poisson equation to compute the electrostatic potential. In addition, to reproduce hydration of ions, ion-water coarse-grained potentials are developed. We demonstrate the EQT framework for EDL by simulating NaCl aqueous electrolyte confined inside slit-like capacitor channels at various ion concentrations and surface charge densities. We show that the ion and water density predictions from EQT agree well with the reference molecular dynamics simulations.","Title: A Discrete Molecular Dynamics Approach to the Study of Disordered and Aggregating Proteins

The combination of accuracy and speed makes the method presented here a good alternative for the exploration of unstructured protein systems. ","Recent EmrE paper:

The topology of helical membrane proteins is generally defined during insertion of the transmembrane helices, yet it is now clear that it is possible for topology to change under unusual circumstances. It remains unclear, however, if topology reorientation is part of normal biogenesis. For dual topology dimer proteins such as the multidrug transporter EmrE, there may be evolutionary pressure to allow topology flipping so that the populations of both orientations can be equalized. We previously demonstrated that when EmrE is forced to insert in a distorted topology, topology flipping of the first transmembrane helix can occur during translation. Here we show that topological malleability also extends to the C-terminal helix and that even complete topology inversion of the entire EmrE protein can occur after the full protein is translated and inserted. Thus, topology rearrangements are possible during normal biogenesis. Wholesale topology flipping is remarkable given the physical constraints of the membrane and expands the range of possible membrane protein folding pathways, both productive and detrimental.","Title: Glycosylation and Lipids Working in Concert Direct CD2 Ectodomain Orientation and Presentation

Abstract Proteins embedded in the plasma membrane mediate interactions with the cell environment and play decisive roles in many signaling events. For cell–cell recognition molecules, it is highly likely that their structures and behavior have been optimized in ways that overcome the limitations of membrane tethering. In particular, the ligand binding regions of these proteins likely need to be maximally exposed. Here we show by means of atomistic simulations of membrane-bound CD2, a small cell adhesion receptor expressed by human T-cells and natural killer cells, that the presentation of its ectodomain is highly dependent on membrane lipids and receptor glycosylation acting in apparent unison. Detailed analysis shows that the underlying mechanism is based on electrostatic interactions complemented by steric interactions between glycans in the protein and the membrane surface. The findings are significant for understanding the factors that render membrane receptors accessible for binding and signaling. ",

Abstract:

We propose a data-driven, coarse-graining formulation in the context of equilibrium statistical mechanics. In contrast to existing techniques which are based on a fine-to- coarse map, we adopt the opposite strategy by prescribing a probabilistic coarse-to-fine map. This corresponds to a directed probabilistic model where the coarse variables play the role of latent generators of the fine scale (all-atom) data. From an information-theoretic perspective, the framework proposed provides an improvement upon the relative entropy method [1] and is capable of quantifying the uncertainty due to the information loss that unavoidably takes place during the coarse-graining process. Furthermore, it can be readily extended to a fully Bayesian model where various sources of uncertainties are reflected in the posterior of the model parameters. The latter can be used to produce not only point estimates of fine-scale reconstructions or macroscopic observables, but more importantly, predictive posterior distributions on these quantities. Predictive posterior distributions reflect the confidence of the model as a function of the amount of data and the level of coarse-graining. The issues of model complexity and model selection are seamlessly addressed by employing a hierarchical prior that favors the discovery of sparse solutions, revealing the most prominent features in the coarse-grained model. A flexible and parallelizable Monte Carlo – Expectation–Maximization (MC-EM) scheme is proposed for carrying out inference and learning tasks. A comparative assessment of the proposed methodology is presented for a lattice spin system and the SPC/E water model.

Abstract Rotational diffusion (Drot) is a fundamental dynamic property of biomolecules that contains information about molecular dimensions and solute-solvent interactions. While ab-initio Drot prediction can be achieved by explicit all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, this is hindered by both computational expense and limitations in water models. We propose coarse-grained forcefields as a complementary solution, and show that the MARTINI forcefield plus elastic networks is sufficient to compute Drot in >10 proteins spanning 5~157 kDa. We also adopt a quaternion-based approach that computes Drot orientation directly from autocorrelations of best-fit rotations as used in, e.g. RMSD algorithms. Over 2-μs trajectories, isotropic MARTINI+EN tumbling replicates experimental values to within 10~20%, with convergence analyses suggesting a minimum sampling of >50×τtheor to achieve sufficient precision. Transient fluctuations in anisotropic tumbling cause decreased precision in predictions of axisymmetric anisotropy and rhombicity, the latter of which cannot be precisely evaluated within 2000×τtheor for GB3. Thus we thus encourage reporting of axial decompositions Dx, Dy, Dz to ease comparability between experiment and simulation. Where protein disorder is absent, we observe close replication of MARTINI+EN Drot orientations versus CHARMM22*/TIP3p and experimental data. This work anticipates the ab-initio prediction of NMR relaxation by combining coarse-grained global motions with all-atom local motions.",,"Hayes, T. W.; Moal, I. H. Modeling Protein Conformational Transition Pathways Using Collective Motions and the LASSO Method. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2017. ASAP

Many proteins can adopt multiple distinct conformational states which often play different functional roles. Previous studies have shown that the underlying global dynamics through which these states are accessed are, at least in part, encoded by the protein's topology. In this work we present a method for generating transition pathways between states by perturbing the protein towards a target conformational state along thermally accessible collective motions calculated from the starting conformation. Specifically, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) is used to identify the most parsimonious route along soft modes calculated using the anisotropic network model. In a survey of 436 conformational changes following protein-protein interaction, we show that such a path exists for most cases and that selected paths are low in energy. We discuss the implications for the atomic modelling of protein recognition, and provide soft energy and parameter bounds which can be employed to efficiently constrain the sampling of such pathways.",

This work improves our previous CG model and extends its applicability beyond the minimal salt conditions, allowing its use at variable ionic strengths. The strategies necessary for the model development are clearly explained and discussed. The effects of the number of stacked quadruplexes and varied salt concentration on the elasticity of the rodlike higher-order quadruplex structures are analyzed. The CG model reproduces the deformations of the terminal parts in agreement with experimental observations without introducing any special parameters for terminal beads and reveals slight differences in the rise and twist of the G-quartet arrangement along the studied biopolymer.

Abstract Thermal quantum time-correlation functions are of fundamental importance in quantum dynamics, allowing experimentally-measurable properties such as reaction rates, diffusion constants and vibrational spectra to be computed from first principles. Since the exact quantum solution scales exponentially with system size, there has been considerable effort in formulating reliable linear-scaling methods involving exact quantum statistics and approximate quantum dynamics modelled with classical-like trajectories. Here we review recent progress in the field with the development of methods including Centroid Molecular Dynamics (CMD), Ring Polymer Molecular Dynamics (RPMD) and Thermostatted RPMD (TRPMD). We show how these methods have recently been obtained from `Matsubara dynamics', a form of semiclassical dynamics which conserves the quantum Boltzmann distribution. We also rederive t->0+ quantum transition-state theory (QTST) in the Matsubara dynamics formalism showing that Matsubara-TST, like RPMD-TST, is equivalent to QTST. We end by surveying areas for future progress.

We introduce a global fitting analysis method to obtain free energies of association of non-covalent molecular clusters using equilibrated cluster size distributions from unbiased constant-temperature molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Because the systems simulated are small enough that the law of mass action does not describe the aggregation statistics, the method relies on iteratively determining a set of cluster free energies that, using appropriately weighted sums over all possible partitions of N monomers into clusters, produces the best-fit size distribution. The quality of these fits can be used as an objective measure of self-consistency to optimize the cut-off distance that determines how clusters are defined. To showcase the method, we have simulated a united-atom model of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) in the vapor phase and in explicit water solution over a range of system sizes (up to 95 MTBE in the vapor phase and 60 MTBE in the aqueous phase) and concentrations at 273 K. The resulting size-dependent cluster free energy functions follow a form derived from classical nucleation theory (CNT) quite well over the full range of cluster sizes, although deviations are more pronounced for small cluster sizes. The CNT fit to cluster free energies yielded surface tensions that were in both cases lower than for the simulated planar interfaces. We use a simple model to derive a condition for minimizing non-ideal effects on cluster size distributions, and show that the cut-off distance that yields the best global fit is con-sistent with this condition.",

Abstract This work presents replica-exchange molecular dynamics simulations of inserting a 16-residue Ebola virus fusion peptide into a membrane bilayer. A computational approach is applied for modeling the peptide at the explicit all-atom level and the membrane-aqueous bilayer by a generalized Born continuum model with a smoothed switching function (GBSW). We provide an assessment of the model calculations in terms of three metrics: (1) the ability to reproduce the NMR structure of the peptide determined in the presence of SDS micelles and comparable structural data on other fusion peptides; (2) determination of the effects of the mutation Trp-8 to Ala and sequence discrimination of the homologous Marburg virus; and (3) calculation of potentials of mean force for estimating the partitioning free energy and their comparison to predictions from the Wimley–White interfacial hydrophobicity scale. We found the GBSW implicit membrane model to produce results of limited accuracy in conformational properties of the peptide when compared to the NMR structure, yet the model resolution is sufficient to determine the effect of sequence differentiation on peptide-membrane integration.",,,

Smoothed Biasing Forces Yield Unbiased Free Energies with the Extended-System Adaptive Biasing Force Method. J. Phys. Chem. B 2016, ASAP.

We report a theoretical description and numerical tests of the extended-system adaptive biasing force method (eABF), together with an unbiased estimator of the free energy surface from eABF dynamics. Whereas the original ABF approach uses its running estimate of the free energy gradient as the adaptive biasing force, eABF is built on the idea that the exact free energy gradient is not necessary for efficient exploration, and that it is still possible to recover the exact free energy separately with an appropriate estimator. eABF does not directly bias the collective coordinates of interest, but rather fictitious variables that are harmonically coupled to them; therefore is does not require second derivative estimates, making it easily applicable to a wider range of problems than ABF. Furthermore, the extended variables present a smoother, coarse-grain-like sampling problem on a mollified free energy surface, leading to faster exploration and convergence. We also introduce CZAR, a simple, unbiased free energy estimator from eABF trajectories. eABF/CZAR converges to the physical free energy surface faster than standard ABF for a wide range of parameters.","M Ndao, F Goujon, A Ghoufi, and P Malfreyt, ""Coarse-grained modeling of the oil–water–surfactant interface through the local definition of the pressure tensor and interfacial tension"" Theor Chem Acc 136, 21 (2017).

Mesoscopic simulations are conducted to study the dodecane–water interface in the presence of an increasing quantity of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Dissipative Particle Dynamics and Molecular Dynamics using the MARTINI force field were used to model the dodecane–SDS–water system through a coarse-grained description. We have used a full description of the water and oil phases to study the structure of the interface. We have calculated the interfacial tension at the dodecane–water interface and established the accuracy of the calculation by checking the mechanical equilibrium and the stability of the interface. The local components of the pressure tensor are calculated along the interface by comparing both atomistic and molecular definitions. Both coarse-grained models give a good description of the system structure, with SDS molecules located at the interfaces. Increasing the number of SDS results in a drastic decrease in the interfacial tension and a saturation of the interface with SDS molecules. Higher SDS concentrations do not affect the interface structure, as it is saturated. The limiting value of the interfacial tension is very low and corresponds to the formation of a SDS film between the dodecane and water phases. Both coarse-grained potentials studied in this work are suitable for the study of surfactants in equilibrium with an oil–water interface. They provide a good description of the dodecane–SDS–water system and quantitative results for interfacial tension and interfacial concentrations.","Title: Binding and Proton Blockage by Amantadine Variants of the Influenza M2WT and M2S31N Explained

Abstract: While aminoadamantanes are well-established inhibitors of the influenza A M2 proton channel, the mechanisms by which they are rendered ineffective against M2S31N are unclear. Solid state NMR, isothermal titration calorimetry, electrophysiology, anti-viral assays and molecular dynamics simulations suggest stronger binding interactions for aminoadamantanes to M2WT compared to negligible or weak binding to M2S31N. This is due to reshaping of the M2pore when N31 is present, which in contrast to WT, leads: A) to the loss of the V27 pocket for the adamantyl cage and to a predominant orientation of the ligand's ammonium group toward the N-terminus and, B) to the lack of a helical kink upon ligand binding. The kink, which reduces the tilt of the C-terminal helical domain relative to the bilayer normal includes the W41 primary gate for proton conductance and may prevent the gate from opening, representing an alternative view for how these drugs prevent proton conductance.",

We explore different schemes for improved accuracy of entropy calculations in aqueous liquid mixtures from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We build upon the two-phase thermodynamic (2PT) model of Lin et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 119, 11792 (2003)] and explore new ways to obtain the partition between the gas-like and solid-like parts of the density of states, as well as the effect of the chosen ideal “combinatorial” entropy of mixing, both of which have a large impact on the results. We also propose a first-order correction to the issue of kinetic energy transfer between degrees of freedom (DoF). This problem arises when the effective temperatures of translational, rotational, and vibrational DoF are not equal, either due to poor equilibration or reduced system size/time sampling, which are typical problems for ab initio MD. The new scheme enables improved convergence of the results with respect to configurational sampling, by up to one order of magnitude, for short MD runs. To ensure a meaningful assessment, we perform MD simulations of liquid mixtures of water with several other molecules of varying sizes: methanol, acetonitrile, N, N-dimethylformamide, and n-butanol. Our analysis shows that results in excellent agreement with experiment can be obtained with little computational effort for some systems. However, the ability of the 2PT method to succeed in these calculations is strongly influenced by the choice of force field, the fluidicity (hard-sphere) formalism employed to obtain the solid/gas partition, and the assumed combinatorial entropy of mixing. We tested two popular force fields, GAFF and OPLS with SPC/E water. For the mixtures studied, the GAFF force field seems to perform as a slightly better “all-around” force field when compared to OPLS+SPC/E.","Makowski, M.; Liwo, A.; Scheraga, H. A.

The physics-based potentials of side-chain–side-chain interactions corresponding to pairs composed of charged and polar, polar and polar, charged and hydrophobic, and hydrophobic and hydrophobic side chains have been determined. A total of 144 four-dimensional potentials of mean force (PMFs) of all possible pairs of molecules modeling these pairs were determined by umbrella-sampling molecular dynamics simulations in explicit water as functions of distance and orientation, and the analytical expressions were then fitted to the PMFs. Depending on the type of interacting sites, the analytical approximation to the PMF is a sum of terms corresponding to van der Waals interactions and cavity-creation involving the nonpolar sections of the side chains and van der Waals, cavity-creation, and electrostatic (charge–dipole or dipole–dipole) interaction energies and polarization energies involving the charged or polar sections of the side chains.

We present a novel method for the study of weak polyelectrolytes and general acid–base reactions in molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations. The approach combines the advantages of the reaction ensemble and the Wang–Landau sampling method. Deprotonation and protonation reactions are simulated explicitly with the help of the reaction ensemble method, while the accurate sampling of the corresponding phase space is achieved by the Wang–Landau approach. The combination of both techniques provides a sufficient statistical accuracy such that meaningful estimates for the density of states and the partition sum can be obtained. With regard to these estimates, several thermodynamic observables like the heat capacity or reaction free energies can be calculated. We demonstrate that the computation times for the calculation of titration curves with a high statistical accuracy can be significantly decreased when compared to the original reaction ensemble method. The applicability of our approach is validated by the study of weak polyelectrolytes and their thermodynamic properties.","Title: Carbon Nanotubes Mediate Fusion of Lipid Vesicles

Abstract: The fusion of lipid membranes is opposed by high energetic barriers. In living organisms, complex protein machineries carry out this biologically essential process. Here we show that membrane-spanning carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can trigger spontaneous fusion of small lipid vesicles. In coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we find that a CNT bridging between two vesicles locally perturbs their lipid structure. Their outer leaflets merge as the CNT pulls lipids out of the membranes, creating an hourglass-shaped fusion intermediate with still intact inner leaflets. As the CNT moves away from the symmetry axis connecting the vesicle centers, the inner leaflets merge, forming a pore that completes fusion. The distinct mechanism of CNT-mediated membrane fusion may be transferable, providing guidance in the development of fusion agents, e.g., for the targeted delivery of drugs or nucleic acids.",

It has been a challenge to compute the binding poses and affinities of peptides to proteins by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Such computations would be valuable for capturing the physics and the conformational freedom of the molecules, but are currently too computationally expensive. Here we describe using MELD-accelerated MD for finding the binding poses and approximate relative binding free energies for flexible-peptide / protein interactions. MELD uses only weak information about the binding motif and not the detailed binding mode that is typically required by other free-energy-based methods. We apply this technique to study binding of P53-derived peptides to MDM2 and MDMX. We find that MELD finds correct poses, that the binding induces the peptide into the correct helical conformation, and that it is capable of roughly estimating relative binding affinities. This method may be useful in peptide drug discovery.","A Hospital, M Candotti, JL Gelpi, and M Orozco, ""The Multiple Roles of Waters in Protein Solvation"" J. Phys. Chem. B 2016 ASAP Article.

Abstract: The mechanosensitive channels of large conductance (MscL) are bacterial membrane proteins that serve as last resort emergency release valves in case of severe osmotic downshock. Sensing bilayer tension, MscL channels are sensitive to changes in the bilayer environment and are, therefore, an ideal test case for exploring membrane protein coupling. Here, we use high-throughput coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to characterize MscL gating kinetics in different bilayer environments under the influence of alcohols. We performed over five hundred simulations to obtain sufficient statistics to reveal the subtle effects of changes in the membrane environment on MscL gating. MscL opening times were found to increase with the addition of the straight-chain alcohols ethanol, octanol and to some extent dodecanol but not with hexadecanol. Increasing concentration of octanol increased the impeding effect, but only up to 10-20 mol%. Our in-silico predictions were experimentally confirmed using reconstituted MscL in a liposomal fluorescent efflux assay. Our combined data reveal that the effect of alcohols on MscL gating arises not through specific binding sites but through a combination of the alcohol-induced changes to a number of bilayer properties and their alteration of the MscL-bilayer interface. Our work provides a key example of how extensive molecular simulations can be used to predict the functional modification of membrane proteins by subtle changes in their bilayer environment.",

Sampling complex potential energies is one of the most pressing challenges of contemporary computational science.

In each replica two copies of the same system with halved potential strengths interact via inelastic springs. The strength of the spring is varied in the different replicas so as to bridge the gap between the infinitely strong spring, that corresponds to the Boltzmann replica and the less tight ones.

Protein conformational change is of central importance in molecular biology. Here we demonstrate a computational approach to characterize the transition between two metastable conformations in all-atom simulations. Our approach is based on the finite temperature string method, and the implementation is essentially a generalization of umbrella sampling simulations with Hamiltonian replica exchange. We represent the transition pathway by a curve in the conformational space, with the curve parameter taken as the reaction coordinate. Our approach can efficiently refine a transition pathway and compute a one-dimensional free energy as a function of the reaction coordinate. A diffusion model can then be used to calculate the forward and backward transition rates, the major kinetic quantities for the transition. We applied the approach on a local transition in the ligand-free Mhp1 transporter, between its outward-facing conformation and an intermediate conformation with the side chain of Phe305 flipped to the outside of the protein. Our simulations predict that the flipped-out position of this side chain has a free energy 6.5 kcal/mol higher than the original position in the crystal structure, and that the forward and backward transition rates are in the millisecond and submicrosecond time scales, respectively.","C.

We have examined two binding pockets on the PH domain and present PMF profiles of the two pockets to account for their preference to PIP2 lipids. Combining orientation analysis and studies of binding pockets, our simulations results reveal valuable molecular basis for protein-lipid interactions of ACAP1 proteins during membrane remodeling process.","Title: Coarse-Grained Molecular Simulation of the Hierarchical Self-Assembly of π-Conjugated Optoelectronic Peptides

Abstract

Self-assembled aggregates of peptides containing aromatic groups possess optoelectronic properties that make them attractive targets for the fabrication of biocompatible electronics. Molecular-level understanding of how the microscopic peptide chemistry influences the properties of the aggregates is vital for rational peptide design. We construct a coarse-grained model of Asp-Phe-Ala-Gly-OPV3-Gly-Ala-Phe-Asp (DFAG-OPV3-GAFD) peptides containing OPV3 (distyrylbenzene) π-conjugated cores explicitly parameterized against all-atom calculations and perform molecular dynamics simulations of the self-assembly of hundreds of molecules over hundreds of nanoseconds. We observe a hierarchical assembly mechanism wherein ∽2-8 peptides assemble into stacks with aligned aromatic cores that subsequently form elliptical aggregates and ultimately a branched network with a fractal dimensionality of ∽1.5. The assembly dynamics are well described by a Smoluchowski coagulation process for which we extract rate constants from the molecular simulations to both furnish insight into the microscopic assembly kinetics and extrapolate our aggregation predictions to time and length scales beyond the reach of molecular simulation. This study presents new molecular-level understanding of the morphology and dynamics of the spontaneous self-assembly of DFAG-OPV3-GAFD peptides and establishes a systematic protocol to develop coarse-grained models of optoelectronic peptides for the exploration and design of π-conjugated peptides with tunable optoelectronic properties.",

Nucleic acids are characterized by a complex hierarchical structure and a variety of interaction mechanisms with other molecules. These features suggest the need of multiscale simulation methods in order to grasp the relevant physical properties of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and RNA using in silico experiments. Here we report an implementation of a dual-resolution modeling of a DNA oligonucleotide in physiological conditions; in the presented setup only the nucleotide molecule and the solvent and ions in its proximity are described at the atomistic level; in contrast, the water molecules and ions far from the DNA are represented as computationally less expensive coarse-grained particles. Through the analysis of several structural and dynamical parameters, we show that this setup reliably reproduces the physical properties of the DNA molecule as observed in reference atomistic simulations. These results represent a first step towards a realistic multiscale modeling of nucleic acids and provide a quantitatively solid ground for their simulation using dual-resolution methods.","Title: A Computational Approach for Modeling Neutron Scattering Data from Lipid Bilayers

Authors: Jan-Michael Y. Carrillo, John Katsaras, Bobby G. Sumpter, and Rana Ashkar

Abstract: Biological cell membranes are responsible for a range of structural and dynamical phenomena crucial to a cell's well-being and its associated functions. Due to the complexity of cell membranes, lipid bilayer systems are often used as biomimetic models. These systems have led to significant insights into vital membrane phenomena such as domain formation, passive permeation and protein insertion. Experimental observations of membrane structure and dynamics are, however, limited in resolution, both spatially and temporally. Importantly, computer simulations are starting to play a more prominent role in interpreting experimental results, enabling a molecular understanding of lipid membranes. In particular, the synergy between scattering experiments and simulations offers opportunities for new discoveries in membrane physics, as the length and time scales probed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations parallel those of experiments. Here, we describe a coarse-grained MD simulation approach that mimics neutron scattering data from large unilamellar lipid vesicles over a range of bilayer rigidity. Specifically, we simulate vesicle form factors and membrane thickness fluctuations determined from small angle neutron scattering (SANS) and neutron spin echo (NSE) experiments, respectively. Our simulations accurately reproduce trends from experiments and lay the groundwork for investigations of more complex membrane systems.

Pavan, From Cooperative Self-Assembly to Water-Soluble Supramolecular Polymers Using Coarse-Grained Simulations, ACS Nano, Article ASAP, DOI: 10.1021/acsnano.6b07628

Abstract:Supramolecular polymers, formed via noncovalent self-assembly of elementary monomers, are extremely interesting for their dynamic bioinspired properties. In order to understand their behavior, it is necessary to access their dynamics while maintaining high resolution in the treatment of the monomer structure and monomer–monomer interactions, which is typically a difficult task, especially in aqueous solution. Focusing on 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxamide (BTA) water-soluble supramolecular polymers, we have developed a transferable coarse-grained model that allows studying BTA supramolecular polymerization in water, while preserving remarkable consistency with the atomistic models in the description of the key interactions between the monomers (hydrophobic, H-bonding, etc.), self-assembly cooperativity, and amplification of order into the growing fibers. This permitted us to monitor the amplification of the key interactions between the monomers (including H-bonding) in the BTA fibers during the dynamic polymerization process. Our molecular dynamics simulations provide a picture of a stepwise cooperative polymerization mechanism, where initial fast hydrophobic aggregation of the BTA monomers in water is followed by the slower reorganization of these disordered aggregates into ordered directional oligomers. Supramolecular polymer growth then proceeds on a slower time scale. We challenged our models via comparison with the experimental evidence, capturing the effect of temperature variations and subtle changes in the monomer structure on the polymerization and on the properties of the fibers seen in the real systems. This work provides a multiscale spatiotemporal characterization of BTA self-assembly in water and a useful platform to study a variety of BTA-based supramolecular polymers toward structure–property relationships.","Title: Examining the role of fluctuations in the early stages of homogenous polymer crystallization with simulation and statistical learning

Abstract

We propose a relationship between the dynamics in the amorphous and crystalline domains during polymer crystallization: the fluctuations of ordering-rate about a material-specific value in the amorphous phase drive those fluctuations associated with the increase in percent crystallinity. This suggests a differential equation that satisfies the three experimentally observed time regimes for the rate of crystal growth. To test this postulated expression, we applied a suite of statistical learning tools to molecular dynamics simulations to extract the relevant phenomenology. This study shows that the proposed relationship holds in the early time regime. It illustrates the effectiveness of soft computing tools in the analysis of coarse-grained simulations in which patterns exist, but may not easily yield to strict quantitative evaluation. This ability assists us in characterizing the critical early time molecular arrangement during the primary nucleation phase of polymer melt crystallization. In addition to supporting the validity of the proposed kinetics expression, the simulations show that (i) the classical nucleation and growth mechanism is active in the early stages of ordering; (ii) the number of nuclei and their masses grow linearly during this early time regime; and (iii) a fixed inter-nuclei distance is established.",
"""Exploring High Dimensional Free Energy Landscapes: Temperature Accelerated Sliced Sampling""
Shalini Awasthi, Nisanth N. Nair
https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08240

Biased sampling of collective variables is widely used to accelerate rare events in molecular simulations and to explore free energy surfaces. However, computational efficiency of these methods decreases with increasing number of collective variables, which severely limits the predictive power of the enhanced sampling approaches. Here we propose a method called Temperature Accelerated Sliced Sampling (TASS) that combines temperature accelerated molecular dynamics with umbrella sampling and metadynamics to sample the collective variable space in an efficient manner. The presented method can sample a large number of collective variables and is advantageous for controlled exploration of broad and unbound free energy basins. TASS is also shown to achieve quick free energy convergence and is practically usable with ab initio molecular dynamics techniques.","Title: Lipid perturbation by membrane proteins and the lipophobic effect

Authors: Jean-Pierre Duneau, Jonathan Khao, and James N. Sturgis

Abstract: Understanding how membrane proteins interact with their environment is fundamental to the understanding of their structure, function and interactions. We have performed coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations on a series of membrane proteins in a membrane environment to examine the perturbations of the lipids by the presence of protein. We analyze these perturbations in terms of elastic membrane deformations and local lipid protein interactions. However these two factors are insufficient to describe the variety of effects that we observe and the changes caused by membranes proteins to the structure and dynamics of their lipid environment. Other factors that change the conformation available to lipid molecules are evident and are able to modify lipid structure far from the protein surface, and thus mediate long-range interactions between membrane proteins. We suggest that these multiple modifications to lipid behavior are responsible, at the molecular level, for the lipophobic effect we have proposed to account for our observations of membrane protein organization.

Abstract:Lipid bilayer membranes have been extensively studied by coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. Numerical efficiencies have been reported in the cases of aggressive coarse-graining, where several lipids are coarse-grained into a particle of size View the MathML source
 so that there is only one particle in the thickness direction. Yuan et al. proposed a pair-potential between these one-particle-thick coarse-grained lipid particles to capture the mechanical properties of a lipid bilayer membrane, such as gel–fluid–gas phase transitions of lipids, diffusion, and bending rigidity Yuan et al. (2010). In this work we implement such an interaction potential in LAMMPS to simulate large-scale lipid systems such as a giant unilamellar vesicle (GUV) and red blood cells (RBCs). We also consider the effect of cytoskeleton on the lipid membrane dynamics as a model for RBC dynamics, and incorporate coarse-grained water molecules to account for hydrodynamic interactions. The interaction between the coarse-grained water molecules (explicit solvent molecules) is modeled as a Lennard-Jones (L-J) potential. To demonstrate that the proposed methods do capture the observed dynamics of vesicles and RBCs, we focus on two sets of LAMMPS simulations: 1. Vesicle shape transitions with enclosed volume; 2. RBC shape transitions with different enclosed volume. Finally utilizing the parallel computing capability in LAMMPS, we provide some timing results for parallel coarse-grained simulations to illustrate that it is possible to use LAMMPS to simulate large-scale realistic complex biological membranes for more than 1 ms.","Title: Analyzing and Driving Cluster Formation in Atomistic Simulations

Abstract

In this paper a new method for identifying the phases contained in a system composed of atoms/molecules is introduced. The method is rooted in graph theory and combines atom centered symmetry functions, adjacency matrices and clustering algorithms to identify regions of space where the properties of the system constituents can be considered uniform. We show how this method can be used to define collective variables and how these collective variables can be used to enhance the sampling of nucleation events. We then show how this method can be used to analyze simulations of crystal nucleation and growth by using it to analyze simulations of the nucleation of the molecular crystal urea and simulations of nucleation in a semiconducting alloy. The semiconducting alloy example we discuss is particular challenging as multiple nucleation centers are formed. We show, however, that our algorithm is able to detect the grain boundaries in the resulting polycrystal.",

Phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) are two of the major anionic and zwitterionic phospholipids in mammalian cell membranes. Ion-PS interaction is hypothesized to play a crucial role in a range of biological events including membrane fusion, lipid phase modulation, membrane protein insertion and translocation. In this study, we characterize using coarse-grained simulations, lipid nanodomain formation in PC/PS mixed bilayers. We investigate the effect of monovalent cation sizes in modulating lipid-ion binding modes and lipid demixing. Our simulations suggest that certain lipid-ion binding modes lead to growth of ion-mediated PS lipid clusters. The existing literature reveals the polymorphism in binding and partitioning patterns in monovalent cations (Na+, K+ and Li+) with anionic lipids. Our work provides a microscopic view on the ion size-dependent PS lipid packing pattern as observed experimentally. A coupled relationship between lipid curvature and asymmetry is observed in highly demixed PC/PS mixed bilayers.","Title: Nonequilibrium Markov state modeling of the globule-stretch transition

Authors: Fabian Knoch and Thomas Speck

Abstract: We describe a systematic approach to construct coarse-grained Markov state models from molecular dynamics data of systems driven into a nonequilibrium steady state. We apply this method to study the globule-stretch transition of a single tethered model polymer in shear flow. The folding and unfolding rates of the coarse-grained model agree with the original detailed model. We demonstrate that the folding and unfolding proceeds through the same narrow region of configuration space but along different cycles.

Vuilleumier, A. M. Saitta and M. Casula, Fully quantum description of the Zundel ion: combining variational quantum Monte Carlo with path integral Langevin dynamics, arXiv:1701.03392

Abstract: We introduce a novel approach for a fully quantum description of coupled electron-ion systems from first principles. It combines the variational quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) solution of the electronic part with the path integral (PI) formalism for the quantum nuclear dynamics. On the one hand, the PI molecular dynamics includes nuclear quantum effects by adding a set of fictitious classical particles (beads) aimed at reproducing nuclear quantum fluctuations via a harmonic kinetic term. On the other hand, variational QMC can provide Born-Oppenheimer (BO) potential energy surfaces with a precision comparable to the most advanced post Hartree-Fock approaches, and with a favorable scaling with the system size. To deal with the intrinsic QMC noise, we generalize the PI molecular dynamics using a Langevin thermostat correlated according to the covariance matrix of QMC nuclear forces. The variational parameters of the QMC wave function are evolved during the nuclear dynamics, such that the BO potential energy surface is unbiased. Statistical errors on the wave function parameters are reduced by resorting to bead grouping average, which we show to be accurate and well controlled. Our general algorithm relies on a Trotter breakup between the dynamics driven by ionic forces and the one set by the harmonic interbead couplings. The latter is exactly integrated even in presence of the Langevin thermostat, thanks to the mapping onto an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. This framework turns out to be very efficient also in the case of deterministic ionic forces. The new implementation is validated on the Zundel ion by direct comparison with standard PI Langevin dynamics calculations made with a coupled cluster potential energy surface. Nuclear quantum effects are confirmed to be dominant over thermal effects well beyond room temperature giving the excess proton an increased mobility by quantum tunneling.","Title: Path integral molecular dynamics with surface hopping for thermal equilibrium sampling of nonadiabatic systems

In this work, a novel ring polymer representation for multi-level quantum system is proposed for thermal average calculations. The proposed presentation keeps the discreteness of the electronic states: besides position and momentum, each bead in the ring polymer is also characterized by a surface index indicating the electronic energy surface. A path integral molecular dynamics with surface hopping (PIMD-SH) dynamics is also developed to sample the equilibrium distribution of ring polymer configurational space. The PIMD-SH sampling method is validated theoretically and by numerical examples.",

Many cellular processes are associated with membrane remodeling. The BAR domain protein family plays a key role in the formation and detection of local membrane curvatures and in attracting other proteins, including the regulators of actin dynamics. Based on their structural and phylogenetic properties, BAR domains are divided into several groups which affect membrane in various ways and perform different functions in cells. However, recent studies have uncovered evidence of functional differences even within the same group. This review discusses the principles underlying the interactions of different groups of BAR domains, and their individual representatives ,with membranes.","Prediction of pKa Values for Druglike Molecules Using Semiempirical Quantum Chemical Methods
Jan H. Jensen, Christopher J. Swain, and Lars Olsen The Journal of Physical Chemistry A Article ASAP DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpca.6b10990
Rapid yet accurate pKa prediction for druglike molecules is a key challenge in computational chemistry. This study uses PM6-DH+/COSMO, PM6/COSMO, PM7/COSMO, PM3/COSMO, AM1/COSMO, PM3/SMD, AM1/SMD, and DFTB3/SMD to predict the pKa values of 53 amine groups in 48 druglike compounds. The approach uses an isodesmic reaction where the pKavalue is computed relative to a chemically related reference compound for which the pKa value has been measured experimentally or estimated using a standard empirical approach. The AM1- and PM3-based methods perform best with RMSE values of 1.4–1.6 pH units that have uncertainties of ±0.2–0.3 pH units, which make them statistically equivalent. However, for all but PM3/SMD and AM1/SMD the RMSEs are dominated by a single outlier, cefadroxil, caused by proton transfer in the zwitterionic protonation state. If this outlier is removed, the RMSE values for PM3/COSMO and AM1/COSMO drop to 1.0 ± 0.2 and 1.1 ± 0.3, whereas PM3/SMD and AM1/SMD remain at 1.5 ± 0.3 and 1.6 ± 0.3/0.4 pH units, making the COSMO-based predictions statistically better than the SMD-based predictions. For pKa calculations where a zwitterionic state is not involved or proton transfer in a zwitterionic state is not observed, PM3/COSMO or AM1/COSMO is the best pKa prediction method; otherwise PM3/SMD or AM1/SMD should be used. Thus, fast and relatively accurate pKa prediction for 100–1000s of druglike amines is feasible with the current setup and relatively modest computational resources.","""Fast coarse-grained model for RNA titration"",

Abstract

In molecular dynamics (MD) calculations, reduction in calculation time per MD loop is essential. A multiple time-step (MTS) integration algorithm, the RESPA (Tuckerman and Berne, J. Chem. Phys. 1992, 97, 1990–2001), enables reductions in calculation time by decreasing the frequency of time-consuming long-range interaction calculations. However, the RESPA MTS algorithm involves uncertainties in evaluating the atomic interaction-based pressure (i.e.; atomic pressure) of systems with and without holonomic constraints. It is not clear which intermediate forces and constraint forces in the MTS integration procedure should be used to calculate the atomic pressure. In this article, we propose a series of equations to evaluate the atomic pressure in the RESPA MTS integration procedure on the basis of its equivalence to the Velocity-Verlet integration procedure with a single time step (STS). The equations guarantee time-reversibility even for the system with holonomic constrants. Furthermore, we generalize the equations to both (i) arbitrary number of inner time steps and (ii) arbitrary number of force components (RESPA levels). The atomic pressure calculated by our equations with the MTS integration shows excellent agreement with the reference value with the STS, whereas pressures calculated using the conventional ad hoc equations deviated from it. Our equations can be extended straightforwardly to the MTS integration algorithm for the isothermal NVT and isothermal–isobaric NPT ensembles.",

We present a systematic coarse-graining (CG) strategy for many particle molecular systems based on cluster expansion techniques. We construct a hierarchy of coarse-grained Hamiltonians with interaction potentials consisting of two, three and higher body interactions. The accuracy of the derived cluster expansion based on interatomic potentials is examined over a range of various temperatures and densities and compared to direct computation of pair potential of mean force. The comparison of the coarse-grained simulations is done on the basis of the structural properties, against the detailed all-atom data. We give specific examples for methane and ethane molecules in which the coarse-grained variable is the center of mass of the molecule. We investigate different temperature and density regimes, and we examine differences between the methane and ethane systems. Results show that the cluster expansion formalism can be used in order to provide accurate effective pair and three-body CG potentials at high T and low ρ regimes. In the liquid regime the three-body effective CG potentials give a small improvement, over the typical pair CG ones; however in order to get significantly better results one needs to consider even higher order terms.","Computing the non-Markovian coarse-grained interactions derived from the Mori–Zwanzig formalism in molecular systems: Application to polymer melts

Memory effects are often introduced during coarse-graining of a complex dynamical system. In particular, a generalized Langevin equation (GLE) for the coarse-grained (CG) system arises in the context of Mori–Zwanzig formalism. Upon a pairwise decomposition, GLE can be reformulated into its pairwise version, i.e., non-Markovian dissipative particle dynamics (DPD). GLE modelsthe dynamics of a single coarse particle, while DPD considers the dynamics of many interacting CG particles, with both CG systems governed by non-Markovian interactions. We compare two different methods for the practical implementation of the non-Markovian interactions in GLE and DPD systems. More specifically, a direct evaluation of the non-Markovian (NM) terms is performed in LE-NM and DPD-NM models, which requires the storage of historical information that significantly increases computational complexity. Alternatively, we use a few auxiliary variables in LE-AUX and DPD-AUX modelsto replace the non-Markovian dynamics with a Markovian dynamics in a higher dimensional space, leading to a much reduced memory footprint and computational cost. In our numerical benchmarks, the GLE and non-Markovian DPD models are constructed from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of star-polymer melts. Results show that a Markovian dynamics with auxiliary variables successfully generates equivalent non-Markovian dynamics consistent with the reference MD system, while maintaining a tractable computational cost. Also, transient subdiffusion of the star-polymers observed in the MD system can be reproduced by the coarse-grained models. The non-interacting particle models, LE-NM/AUX, are computationally much cheaper than the interacting particle models, DPD-NM/AUX. However, the pairwise models withmomentum conservation are more appropriate for correctly reproducing the long-time hydrodynamics characterised by an algebraic decay in the velocity autocorrelation function.","""Three-body potential for simulating bond swaps in molecular dynamics""

Novel soft matter materials join the resistance of a permanent mesh of strong inter-particle bonds with the self-healing and restructuring properties allowed by bond-swapping processes. Theoretical and numerical studies of the dynamics of coarse-grained models of covalent adaptable networks and vitrimers require effective algorithms for modelling the corresponding evolution of the network topology. Here I propose a simple trick for performing molecular dynamics simulations of bond-swapping network systems with particle-level description. The method is based on the addition of a computationally non-expensive three-body repulsive potential that encodes for the single-bond per particle condition and establishes a flat potential energy surface for the bond swap.","Title: All Atom Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Entire Virus Capsid Reveal the Role of Ion Distribution in Capsid’s Stability

Abstract

Present experimental methods do not have sufficient resolution to investigate all processes in virus particles at atomistic details. We report the results of molecular dynamics simulations and analyze the connection between the number of ions inside an empty capsid of PCV2 virus and its stability. We compare the crystallographic structures of the capsids with unresolved N-termini and without them in realistic conditions (room temperature and aqueous solution) and show that the structure is preserved. We find that the chloride ions play a key role in the stability of the capsid. A low number of chloride ions results in loss of the native icosahedral symmetry, while an optimal number of chloride ions create a neutralizing layer next to the positively charged inner surface of the capsid. Understanding the dependence of the capsid stability on the distribution of the ions will help clarify the details of the viral life cycle that is ultimately connected to the role of packaged viral genome inside the capsid.",

The free energy based Lennard-Jones 12-6 (FE-12-6) coarse-grained (CG) force field developed for alkanes1 has been extended to model small molecules of light hydrocarbons (methane, ethane, propane, butane, and isobutane), nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide. The adjustable parameters of the FE-12-6 potential are determined by fitting against experimental vapor–liquid equilibrium (VLE) curves and heat of vaporization (HOV) data for pure substance liquids. Simulations using the optimized FE-12-6 parameters correctly reproduced experimental measures of the VLE, HOV, density, vapor pressure, compressibility, critical point, and surface tension for pure substances over a wide range of thermodynamic states. The force field parameters optimized for pure substances were tested on methane/butane, nitrogen/decane, and carbon dioxide/decane binary mixtures to predict their vapor-liquid equilibrium phase diagrams. It is found that for nonpolar molecules represented by different sized beads, a common scaling factor (0.08) that reduces the strength of the interaction potential between unlike beads, generated using Lorentz–Berthelot (LB) combination rules, is required to predict vapor-liquid phase equilibria accurately.","Colloidal transport by active filaments

Enhanced colloidal transport beyond the limit imposed by diffusion is usually achieved through external fields. Here, we demonstrate the ballistic transportof a colloidal sphere using internal sources of energy provided by an attached active filament. The latter is modeled as a chain of chemo-mechanically active beads connected by potentials that enforce semi-flexibility and self-avoidance. The fluid flow produced by the active beads and the forces they mediate are explicitly taken into account in the overdamped equations of motion describing the colloid-filament assembly. The speed and efficiency of transport depend on the dynamical conformational states of the filament. We characterize these states using filament writhe as an order parameter and identify ones yielding maxima in speed and efficiency of transport. The transport mechanism reported here has a remarkable resemblance to the flagellar propulsion of microorganisms which suggests its utility in biomimetic systems.","""Molecular Details of the PH Domain of ACAP1BAR-PH Protein Binding to PIP-Containing Membrane""

ACAP1 proteins were previously reported to specifically bind PIP2-containing cell membranes and form well-structured protein lattices in order to conduct membrane tubulation. We carried out molecular dynamics simulations to characterize orientation of the PH domains with respect to the BAR domains inside the protein dimer. Followed by molecular dynamics simulations, we present a comprehensive orientation analysis of PH domain under different states including unbound and bound with lipids. We have examined two binding pockets on the PH domain and present PMF profiles of the two pockets to account for their preference to PIP2 lipids. Combining orientation analysis and studies of binding pockets, our simulations results reveal valuable molecular basis for protein-lipid interactions of ACAP1 proteins during membrane remodeling process.","Galimzyanov, T. R.; Kuzmin, P. I.; Pohl, P.; Akimov, S. A. Undulations Drive Domain Registration from the Two Membrane Leaflets. Biophys. J. 2017, 112, 339–345.

Phase separation in biological membranes plays an important role in protein targeting and transmembrane signaling. Its occurrence in both membrane leaflets commonly gives rise to matching liquid or liquid-ordered domains in the opposing monolayers. The underlying mechanism of such co-localization is not fully understood. The decrease of the line tension around the thicker ordered domain constitutes an important driving force. Yet, robust domain coupling requires an additional energy source, which we have now identified as thermal undulations. Our theoretical analysis of elastic deformations in a lipid bilayer shows that stiffer lipid domains tend to distribute into areas with lower fluctuations of monolayer curvature. These areas naturally align in the opposing monolayers. Thus, coupling requires both membrane leafs to display a heterogeneity in splay rigidities. The heterogeneity may either originate from intrinsic lipid properties or be acquired by adsorption of peripheral molecules. Undulations and line tension act synergistically: the gain in energy due a minimized line tension is proportional to domain radius and thus primarily fuels the registration of smaller domains; whereas the energetic contribution of undulations increases with membrane area and thus primarily acts to coalesce larger domains.",

Biological cell membranes are responsible for a range of structural and dynamical phenomena crucial to a cell's well-being and its associated functions. Due to the complexity of cell membranes, lipid bilayer systems are often used as biomimetic models. These systems have led to significant insights into vital membrane phenomena such as domain formation, passive permeation and protein insertion. Experimental observations of membrane structure and dynamics are, however, limited in resolution, both spatially and temporally. Importantly, computer simulations are starting to play a more prominent role in interpreting experimental results, enabling a molecular understanding of lipid membranes. In particular, the synergy between scattering experiments and simulations offers opportunities for new discoveries in membrane physics, as the length and time scales probed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations parallel those of experiments. Here, we describe a coarse-grained MD simulation approach that mimics neutron scattering data from large unilamellar lipid vesicles over a range of bilayer rigidity. Specifically, we simulate vesicle form factors and membrane thickness fluctuations determined from small angle neutron scattering (SANS) and neutron spin echo (NSE) experiments, respectively.

Design Principles for Robust Vesiculation in Clathrin-Mediated Endocytosis. bioRxiv 2016.

A critical step in cellular trafficking pathways is the budding of membranes by protein coats, which recent experiments have demonstrated can be inhibited by elevated membrane tension. The robustness of processes like clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) across a diverse range of organisms and mechanical environments suggests that the protein machinery in this process has evolved to take advantage of some set of physical design principles to ensure robust vesiculation against opposing forces like membrane tension. Using a theoretical model for membrane mechanics and membrane protein interaction, we have systematically investigated the influence of membrane rigidity, curvature induced by the protein coat, area covered by the protein coat, membrane tension and force from actin polymerization on bud formation. Under low tension, the membrane smoothly evolves from a flat to budded morphology as the coat area or spontaneous curvature increases, whereas the membrane remains essentially flat at high tensions. At intermediate, physiologically relevant, tensions, the membrane undergoes a snapthrough instability in which small changes in the coat area, spontaneous curvature or membrane tension cause the membrane to ""snap"" from an open, U-shape to a closed bud. This instability can be smoothed out by increasing the bending rigidity of the coat, allowing for successful budding at higher membrane tensions. Additionally, applied force from actin polymerization can bypass the instability by inducing a smooth transition from an open to a closed bud. Finally, a combination of increased coat rigidity and force from actin polymerization enables robust vesiculation even at high membrane tensions.",

In particular, a generalized Langevin equation (GLE) for the coarse-grained (CG) system arises in the context of Mori–Zwanzig formalism. Upon a pairwise decomposition, GLE can be reformulated into its pairwise version, i.e., non-Markovian dissipative particle dynamics (DPD). GLE models the dynamics of a single coarse particle, while DPD considers the dynamics of many interacting CG particles, with both CG systems governed by non-Markovian interactions. We compare two different methods for the practical implementation of the non-Markovian interactions in GLE and DPD systems. More specifically, a direct evaluation of the non-Markovian (NM) terms is performed in LE-NM and DPD-NM models, which requires the storage of historical information that significantly increases computational complexity. Alternatively, we use a few auxiliary variables in LE-AUX and DPD-AUX models to replace the non-Markovian dynamics with a Markovian dynamics in a higher dimensional space, leading to a much reduced memory footprint and computational cost. In our numerical benchmarks, the GLE and non-Markovian DPD models are constructed from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of star-polymer melts. Results show that a Markovian dynamics with auxiliary variables successfully generates equivalent non-Markovian dynamics consistent with the reference MD system, while maintaining a tractable computational cost. Also, transient subdiffusion of the star-polymers observed in the MD system can be reproduced by the coarse-grained models. The non-interacting particle models, LE-NM/AUX, are computationally much cheaper than the interacting particle models, DPD-NM/AUX. However, the pairwise models with momentum conservation are more appropriate for correctly reproducing the long-time hydrodynamics characterised by an algebraic decay in the velocity autocorrelation function.",,"Nemec, M.; Hoffmann, D. Quantitative Assessment of Molecular Dynamics Sampling for Flexible Systems. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2017, ASAP.

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is a natural method for the study of flexible molecules but at the same time is limited by the large size of the conformational space of these molecules. We ask by how much the MD sampling quality for flexible molecules can be improved by two means: the use of diverse sets of trajectories starting from different initial conformations to detect deviations between samples and sampling with enhanced methods such as accelerated MD (aMD) or scaled MD (sMD) that distort the energy landscape in controlled ways. To this end, we test the effects of these approaches on MD simulations of two flexible biomolecules in aqueous solution, Met-Enkephalin (5 amino acids) and HIV-1 gp120 V3 (a cycle of 35 amino acids). We assess the convergence of the sampling quantitatively with known, extensive measures of cluster number Nc and cluster distribution entropy Sc and with two new quantities, conformational overlap Oconf and density overlap Odens, both conveniently ranging from 0 to 1. These new overlap measures quantify self-consistency of sampling in multitrajectory MD experiments, a necessary condition for converged sampling. A comprehensive assessment of sampling quality of MD experiments identifies the combination of diverse trajectory sets and aMD as the most efficient approach among those tested. However, analysis of Odens between conventional and aMD trajectories also reveals that we have not completely corrected aMD sampling for the distorted energy landscape. Moreover, for V3, the courses of Nc and Odens indicate that much higher resources than those generally invested today will probably be needed to achieve convergence. The comparative analysis also shows that conventional MD simulations with insufficient sampling can be easily misinterpreted as being converged.",

Abstract: Understanding structure formation in polypeptide chains and synthetic polymers encapsulated in pores is important in biology and nanotechnology. We present replica exchange molecular dynamics studies of the phase diagram for α-helix formation of capped polyalanine in nanotubes (NT) open to a water reservoir as a function of the NT diameter and hydrophobicity. A helix forms only in a narrow range of diameters, which surprisingly is comparable to the width of the ribosome tunnel. Increasing the hydrophobicity enhances helicity in the NT. Helix formation in polyalanine is driven by a small negative enthalpy and a positive entropy change at ≈ 300 K, in contrast to the large negative entropy change that destabilizes the helix and favors the coiled state in bulk water. There is an anticorrelation between water density inside the nanotube and structure formation. Confinement-induced helix formation depends on amino acid sequence. There is complete absence of helix in polyglutamine and polyserine confined to a open carbon nanotube.",,"Shao, Q.; Shi, J.; Zhu, W.

In comparison to REMD, P-ITS significantly reduces the requirement of computational resource and meanwhile achieve similar simulation results. The observed structural characterizations of transition and intermediate states of the proteins under study are in good agreement with previous experimental and simulation studies on the same proteins and homologs.

Abstract: Estimating the transition rates and selectivity of multi-pathway systems with molecular dynamics simulations is expensive and often requires arduous sampling of many individual pathways. Developing a way to efficiently sample and characterize multi-pathway systems creates an opportunity to apply these tools to study systems that, previously, would have had a prohibitive computational cost. We present an approach that places quartic boundaries at the saddle points to isolate individual pathways without changing their observed rates, reducing the required number of events sampled and estimated rate uncertainty. In addition to rates, the selectivity between pathways is also accurately predicted as well. To further reduce the computational cost of the analysis, we have paired this approach with the infrequent metadynamics method. The method is demonstrated on model systems and stiffened alanine dipeptide. Furthermore, we present an appropriate method for recovering the energy barriers of specific transition paths by taking the slope of an Arrhenius plot generated from the infrequent metadynamics results at various temperatures. We also compare this method against another previously published literature to demonstrate its superior performance. In the future, these methods can be used in a variety of contexts where competing escape pathways with different barriers are relevant.",,"Title: Dynamic interactions between a membrane binding protein and lipids induce fluctuating diffusivity

Abstract: Biological cell membranes are responsible for a range of structural and dynamical phenomena crucial to a cell's well-being and its associated functions. Due to the complexity of cell membranes, lipid bilayer systems are often used as biomimetic models. These systems have led to significant insights into vital membrane phenomena such as domain formation, passive permeation and protein insertion. Experimental observations of membrane structure and dynamics are, however, limited in resolution, both spatially and temporally. Importantly, computer simulations are starting to play a more prominent role in interpreting experimental results, enabling a molecular understanding of lipid membranes. In particular, the synergy between scattering experiments and simulations offers opportunities for new discoveries in membrane physics, as the length and time scales probed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations parallel those of experiments. Here, we describe a coarse-grained MD simulation approach that mimics neutron scattering data from large unilamellar lipid vesicles over a range of bilayer rigidity. Specifically, we simulate vesicle form factors and membrane thickness fluctuations determined from small angle neutron scattering (SANS) and neutron spin echo (NSE) experiments, respectively. Our simulations accurately reproduce trends from experiments and lay the groundwork for investigations of more complex membrane systems.

Abstract

Solid polymer electrolytes (SPE) have the potential to increase both the energy density and stability of lithium-based batteries, but low Li+ conductivity remains a barrier to technological viability. SPEs are designed to maximize Li+ diffusivity relative to the anion, while maintaining sufficient salt solubility. It is thus remarkable that polyethylene oxide (PEO), the most widely used SPE, exhibits Li+ diffusivity that is an order of magnitude smaller than that of typical counter-ions at moderate salt concentrations. We show that Lewis-basic polymers like PEO favor slow cation and rapid anion diffusion while this relationship can be reversed in Lewis-acidic polymers. Using molecular dynamics, polyboranes are identified that achieve up to ten-fold increases in Li+ diffusivities and signicant decreases in anion diffusivities, relative to PEO in the dilute-ion regime. These results illustrate a general principle for increasing Li+ diffusivity and transference number with chemistries that exhibit weaker cation and stronger anion coordination.

Authors: G. J. A. Sevink, F. Schmid, T. Kawakatsu and G. Milano

Abstract: We have extended an existing hybrid MD-SCF simulation technique that employs a coarsening step to enhance the computational efficiency of evaluating non-bonded particle interactions. This technique is conceptually equivalent to the single chain in mean-field (SCMF) method in polymer physics, in the sense that non-bonded interactions are derived from the non-ideal chemical potential in self-consistent field (SCF) theory, after a particle-to-field projection. In contrast to SCMF, however, MD-SCF evolves particle coordinates by the usual Newton's equation of motion. Since collisions are seriously affected by the softening of non-bonded interactions that originates from their evaluation at the coarser continuum level, we have devised a way to reinsert the effect of collisions on the structural evolution. Merging MD-SCF with multi-particle collision dynamics (MPCD), we mimic particle collisions at the level of computational cells and at the same time properly account for the momentum transfer that is important for a realistic system evolution. The resulting hybrid MD-SCF/MPCD method was validated for a particular coarse-grained model of phospholipids in aqueous solution, against reference full-particle simulations and the original MD-SCF model. We additionally implemented and tested an alternative and more isotropic finite difference gradient. Our results show that efficiency is improved by merging MD-SCF with MPCD, as properly accounting for hydrodynamic interactions considerably speeds up the phase separation dynamics, with negligible additional computational costs compared to efficient MD-SCF. This new method enables realistic simulations of large-scale systems that are needed to investigate the applications of self-assembled structures of lipids in nanotechnologies.

Abstract

Lipopolysaccharides are vital components of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, and they act as extremely strong stimulators of innate immunity in diverse eukaryotic species. The primary immunostimulatory center of the LPS molecule is lipid A—a disaccharide-bound lipophilic domain. Considering the broad diversity in bacterial species, there are variations in the lipid A structure and their immunogenic potency. In this work, we model the lipid A structures of eight commensal or human pathogenic bacterial species: Helicobacter pylori, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydia trachomatis, Campylobacter jejuni, Neisseria meningitidis, and Salmonella minnesota. The membrane properties of these bacterial species were characterized and compared using molecular simulations. The structure-property relationships that emerge from this lipid A molecular library highlight the roles of acyl chain lengths, number of chains, phosphorylation state, membrane composition and charge of the counterions in regulating the phase transition temperature of the membrane, diffusion coefficient of the lipids, and membrane thickness. Molecular and structural insights provided reveal the diversity of in bacterial outer membrane lipids and their contribution to human disease and immunity.",,"Coarse-Grained Molecular Simulation of the Hierarchical Self-Assembly of π-Conjugated Optoelectronic Peptides

Self-assembled aggregates of peptides containing aromatic groups possess optoelectronic properties that make them attractive targets for the fabrication of biocompatible electronics. Molecular-level understanding of how the microscopic peptide chemistry influences the properties of the aggregates is vital for rational peptide design. We construct a coarse-grained model of Asp-Phe-Ala-Gly-OPV3-Gly-Ala-Phe-Asp (DFAG-OPV3-GAFD) peptides containing OPV3 (distyrylbenzene) π-conjugated cores explicitly parameterized against all-atom calculations and perform molecular dynamics simulations of the self-assembly of hundreds of molecules over hundreds of nanoseconds. We observe a hierarchical assembly mechanism wherein ∽2-8 peptides assemble into stacks with aligned aromatic cores that subsequently form elliptical aggregates and ultimately a branched network with a fractal dimensionality of ∽1.5. The assembly dynamics are well described by a Smoluchowski coagulation process for which we extract rate constants from the molecular simulations to both furnish insight into the microscopic assembly kinetics and extrapolate our aggregation predictions to time and length scales beyond the reach of molecular simulation. This study presents new molecular-level understanding of the morphology and dynamics of the spontaneous self-assembly of DFAG-OPV3-GAFD peptides and establishes a systematic protocol to develop coarse-grained models of optoelectronic peptides for the exploration and design of π-conjugated peptides with tunable optoelectronic properties.",

Abstract

Gemini surfactants cause a lot of concerns owing to their unusual aggregation morphologies and superior physicochemical properties over the conventional surfactants. Research shows that the unique structure of Gemini surfactants, especially the spacer group, has great impact on the self-assembly behaviors. To understand the determinants of this behavior on the molecular level, we carried out coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations on aqueous solutions of alkanediyl-a,w-bis (dimethylcetylammonium bromide)-based surfactants with different spacer group lengths. Our simulation results demonstrated that the self-assemble morphologies of Gemini changed from spherical micelles, wormlike micelles to vesicles with the decrease in spacer length, which were qualitatively consistent with the experimental observations. Both the microscopic dynamics processes and the self-assembly mechanisms for the formation of spherical micelles, wormlike micelles and vesicles were systematically studied through the CGMD simulations. In addition, based on the microscopic analysis, a strategy was proposed to predict self-assembled morphology of surfactant-based systems based on simulation. This work lighted new views on the understanding of the Gemini surfactants’ self-assembly at a molecular-level and the proposed predicting strategy showed promising for practical applications.

A detailed insight of key reactive events related to oxidation and pyrolysis of hydrocarbon fuels further enhances our understanding of combustion chemistry. Though comprehensive kinetic models are available for smaller hydrocarbons (typically C3 or lower), developing and validating reaction mechanisms for larger hydrocarbons is a daunting task, due to the complexity of their reaction networks. The ReaxFF method provides an attractive computational method to obtain reaction kinetics for complex fuel and fuel mixtures, providing an accuracy approaching ab-initio-based methods but with a significantly lower computational expense. The development of the first ReaxFF combustion force field by Chenoweth et al. (CHO-2008 parameter set) in 2008 has opened new avenues for researchers to investigate combustion chemistry from the atomistic level. In this article, we seek to address two issues with the CHO-2008 ReaxFF description. While the CHO-2008 description has achieved significant popularity for studying large hydrocarbon combustion, it fails to accurately describe the chemistry of small hydrocarbon oxidation, especially conversion of CO2 from CO, which is highly relevant to syngas combustion. Additionally, the CHO-2008 description was obtained faster than expected H abstraction by O2from hydrocarbons, thus underestimating the oxidation initiation temperature. In this study, we seek to systemically improve the CHO-2008 description and validate it for these cases. Additionally, our aim was to retain the accuracy of the 2008 description for larger hydrocarbons and provide similar quality results. Thus, we expanded the ReaxFF CHO-2008 DFT-based training set by including reactions and transition state structures relevant to the syngas and oxidation initiation pathways and retrained the parameters. To validate the quality of our force field, we performed high-temperature NVT-MD simulations to study oxidation and pyrolysis of four different hydrocarbon fuels, namely, syngas, methane, JP-10, and n-butylbenzene. Results obtained from syngas and methane oxidation simulation indicated that our redeveloped parameters (named as the CHO-2016 parameter set) has significantly improved the C1chemistry predicted by ReaxFF and has solved the low-temperature oxidation initiation problem. Moreover, Arrhenius parameters of JP-10 decomposition and initiation mechanism pathways ofn-butylbenzene pyrolysis obtained using the CHO-2016 parameter set are also in good agreement with both experimental and CHO-2008 simulation results. This demonstrated the transferability of the CHO-2016 description for a wide range of hydrocarbon chemistry.

Abstract

We extend the use of the adaptive resolution method (AdResS) in its Grand Canonical-like version (GC-AdResS) to the molecular dynamics simulation of 1,3-dimethylimidazolium chloride. We show that the partitioning of the total system in a subsystem of interest with atomistic details and a reservoir of coarse-grained particles leads to satisfactory results. The challenging aspect of this study, compared to previous AdResS simulations, is the presence of charged particles and the necessity of addressing the question about the minimal physical input needed to model the coarse-grained particles in the reservoir. We propose two different approaches and show that in both cases they are sufficient to capture the decisive physical characteristics that allow a valid system-reservoir coupling. The technical satisfactory result paves the way for multiscale analysis of ionic liquids and for truly open boundary molecular simulations.

Abstract

In this article, an implementation of steered molecular dynamics (SMD) in coarse-grain UNited RESidue (UNRES) simulations package is presented. Two variants of SMD have been implemented: with a constant force and a constant velocity. The huge advantage of SMD implementation in the UNRES force field is that it allows to pull with the speed significantly lower than the accessible pulling speed in simulations with all-atom representation of a system, with respect to a reasonable computational time. Therefore, obtaining pulling speed closer to those which appear in the atomic force spectroscopy is possible. The newly implemented method has been tested for behavior in a microcanonical run to verify the influence of introduction of artificial constrains on keeping total energy of the system. Moreover, as time dependent artificial force was introduced, the thermostat behavior was tested. The new method was also tested via unfolding of the Fn3 domain of human contactin 1 protein and the I27 titin domain. Obtained results were compared with Gø-like force field, all-atom force field, and experimental results.",,"Thermodynamics and simulation of hard-sphere fluid and solid: Kinetic Monte Carlo method versus standard Metropolis scheme

The paper aims at a comparison of techniques based on the kinetic Monte Carlo(kMC) and the conventional Metropolis Monte Carlo (MC) methods as applied to the hard-sphere (HS) fluid and solid. In the case of the kMC, an alternative representation of the chemical potential is explored [E. A. Ustinov and D. D. Do, J. Colloid Interface Sci. 366, 216 (2012)], which does not require any external procedure like the Widom test particle insertion method. A direct evaluation of the chemical potential of the fluid and solid without thermodynamic integration is achieved by molecular simulation in an elongated box with an external potential imposed on the system in order to reduce the particle density in the vicinity of the box ends. The existence of rarefied zones allows one to determine the chemical potential of the crystalline phase and substantially increases its accuracy for the disordered dense phase in the central zone of the simulation box. This method is applicable to both the Metropolis MC and the kMC, but in the latter case, the chemical potential is determined with higher accuracy at the same conditions and the number of MC steps. Thermodynamic functions of the disordered fluid and crystalline face-centered cubic (FCC) phase for the hard-sphere system have been evaluated with the kinetic MC and the standard MC coupled with the Widom procedure over a wide range of density. The melting transition parameters have been determined by the point of intersection of the pressure–chemical potential curves for the disordered HS fluid and FCC crystal using the Gibbs–Duhem equation as a constraint. A detailed thermodynamic analysis of the hard-sphere fluid has provided a rigorous verification of the approach, which can be extended to more complex systems.",
