Various models for lipid bilayer membranes have been presented to investigate their morphologies. Among them, the aggressive coarse-grained models, where the membrane is represented by a single layer of particles, are computationally efficient and of practical importance for simulating membrane dynamics at the microscopic scale. In these models, soft potentials between particle pairs are used to maintain the fluidity of membranes, but the underlying mechanism of the softening requires further clarification. We have analyzed the membrane area decrease due to thermal fluctuations, and the results demonstrate that the intraparticle part of entropic elasticity is responsible for the softening of the potential. Based on the stretching response of the membrane, a bottom-up model is developed with an entropic effect explicitly involved. The model reproduces several essential properties of the lipid membrane, including the fluid state and a plateau in the stretching curve. In addition, the area compressibility modulus, bending rigidity, and spontaneous curvature display linear dependence on model parameters. As a demonstration, we have investigated the closure and morphology evolution of membrane systems driven by spontaneous curvature, and vesicle shapes observed experimentally are faithfully reproduced","Title: Configuration-sampling-based surrogate models for rapid parameterization of non-bonded interactions, Authors: Richard A. Messerly, Seyed Mostafa Razavi, and Michael R. Shirts, Journal: Journal of chemical theory and computation, DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00223, Publication (web): May 4, 2018, Abstract: In this study, we present an approach for rapid force field parameterization and uncertainty quantification of the non-bonded interaction parameters for classical force fields. The accuracy of most thermophysical properties, and especially vapor-liquid equilibria (VLE), obtained from molecular simulation depends strongly on the non-bonded interactions. Traditionally, non-bonded interactions are parameterized to agree with macroscopic properties by performing large amounts of direct molecular simulation. Due to the computational cost of molecular simulation, surrogate models (i.e. efficient models that approximate direct molecular simulation results) are an essential tool for high-dimensional parameterization and uncertainty quantification of non-bonded interactions. The present study compares two different configuration-sampling-based surrogate models, namely, Multistate Bennett Acceptance Ratio (MBAR) and Pair Correlation Function Rescaling (PCFR). MBAR and PCFR are coupled with the Isothermal Isochoric (ITIC) thermodynamic integration method for estimating vapor-liquid saturation properties. We find that MBAR and PCFR are complementary in their roles. Specifically, PCFR is preferred when exploring distant regions of the parameter space while MBAR is better in the local domain.","Lipid tempering simulation of model biological membranes on parallel platforms

In this report we have tested a parallel implementation for the simulation of lipid bilayers at the atomistic level, based on a generalized ensemble protocol where only the torsional degrees of freedom of the alkyl chains of the lipids are heated. The results in terms of configurational sampling enhancement have been compared with a conventional simulation produced with a widespread molecular dynamics code. Results show that the proposed thermodynamic-based multiple trajectories parallel protocol for membrane simulations allows for an efficient use of CPU resources with respect to the conventional single trajectory, providing accurate results for area and volume per lipid, membrane thickness, undulation spectra and boosting significantly diffusion and mixing in lipid bilayers due to the sampling enhancement of gauche/trans ratios of the alkyl chain dihedral angles.","Title: Better than counting: density profiles from force sampling, Authors: Daniel de las Heras and Matthias Schmidt, Journal: Physical Review Letters, Publication date: 24 May 2018, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.218001, Abstract: Calculating one-body density profiles in equilibrium via particle-based simulation methods involves counting of events of particle occurrences at (histogram-resolved) space points. Here, we investigate an alternative method based on a histogram of the local force density. Via an exact sum rule, the density profile is obtained with a simple spatial integration. The method circumvents the inherent ideal gas fluctuations. We have tested the method in Monte Carlo, Brownian dynamics, and molecular dynamics simulations. The results carry a statistical uncertainty smaller than that of the standard counting method, reducing therefore the computation time.",

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsb.2018.04.004

Symmetry in protein, and, more generally, in macromolecular assemblies is a key point to understand their structure, stability and function. Many symmetrical assemblies are currently present in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and some of them are among the largest solved structures, thus an efficient computational method is needed for the exhaustive analysis of these. The cyclic symmetry groups represent the most common assemblies in the PDB. These are also the building blocks for higher-order symmetries. This paper presents a mathematical formulation to find the position and the orientation of the symmetry axis in a cyclic symmetrical protein assembly, and also to assess the quality of this symmetry. Our method can also detect symmetries in partial assemblies. We provide an efficient C++ implementation of the method and demonstrate its efficiency on several examples including partial assemblies and pseudo symmetries. We also compare the method with two other published techniques and show that it is significantly faster on all the tested examples. Our method produces results with a machine precision, its cost function is solely based on 3D Euclidean geometry, and most of the operations are performed analytically. The method is available at http://team.inria.fr/nano-d/software/ananas. The graphical user interface of the method built for the SAMSON platform is available at http://samson-connect.net.","Title: Influence of cholesterol on the dynamics of hydration in phospholipid bilayers, Authors: Maria Dolores Elola and Javier Rodriguez, Journal: Journal of physical chemistry B, DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b00360, Publications (web): May 9, 2018, Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of interfacial waters in dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayers upon the addition of cholesterol, by molecular dynamics simulations. Our data reveal that the inclusion of cholesterol modifies the membrane aqueous interfacial dynamics: waters diffuse faster, their rotational decay time is shorter, and the DPPC/water hydrogen bond dynamics relaxes faster than in the pure DPPC membrane. The observed acceleration of the translational water dynamics agrees with recent experimental results, in which, by means of NMR techniques, an increment of the surface water diffusivity is measured upon the addition of cholesterol. A microscopic analysis of the lipid/water hydrogen bond network at the interfacial region suggests that the mechanism underlying the observed water mobility enhancement is given by the rupture of a fraction of inter-lipid water bridge hydrogen bonds connecting two different DPPC molecules, concomitant to the formation of new lipid/solvent bonds, whose dynamics is faster than that of the former. The consideration of a simple two-state model for the decay of the hydrogen bond correlation function yielded excellent results, obtaining two well separated characteristic time scales: a slow one (~ 250 ps) associated to bonds linking two DPPC molecules, and a fast one (~ 15 ps), related to DPPC/solvent bonds","HIV-1 Matrix Protein Interactions with tRNA: Implications for Membrane Targeting

The N-terminally myristoylated matrix domain (MA) of the HIV-1 Gag polyprotein promotes virus assembly by targeting Gag to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (PM). Recent studies indicate that, prior to membrane binding, MA associates with cytoplasmic tRNAs (including tRNALys3), and in vitro studies of tRNA-dependent MA interactions with model membranes have led to proposals that competitive tRNA interactions contribute to membrane discrimination. We have characterized interactions between native, mutant, and unmyristylated (myr-) MA proteins and recombinant tRNALys3 by NMR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). NMR experiments confirm that tRNALys3 interacts with a patch of basic residues that are also important for binding to the plasma membrane marker, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate, [PI(4,5)P2]. Unexpectedly, the affinity of MA for tRNALys3 (Kd = 0.63 ± 0.03 μM) is approximately one order of magnitude greater than its affinity for PI(4,5)P2 enriched liposomes (Kd(apparent) = 10.2 ± 2.1 μM), and NMR studies indicate that tRNALys3 binding blocks MA association with liposomes, including those enriched with PI(4,5)P2, phosphatidylserine (PS), and cholesterol. However, the affinity of MA for tRNALys3 is diminished by mutations or sample conditions that promote myristate exposure. Since Gag-Gag interactions are known to promote myristate exposure, our findings support virus assembly models in which membrane targeting and genome binding are mechanistically coupled.","Title: Relevance of the speed and direction of pulling in simple modular proteins, Authors: Carlos A Plata, Zackary N. Scholl, Piotr E Marszalek and Antonio Prados, Journal: Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation, Publication date: May 17, 2018, DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00347, Abstract: A theoretical framework capable of predicting the first unit that unfolds in pulled modular proteins has been recently introduced, for “fast enough” pulling velocities. Within this picture, we investigate the unfolding pathway in a chain of identical units and predict that the module closest to the pulled end opens first. Steered molecular dynamics of a simple construct, specifically a chain composed of two coiled-coil motives, shows that this is indeed the case. Notwithstanding, the unfolding behavior strongly depends on the terminus (C or N) from which this homopolyprotein is pulled. Therefore, anisotropic features are revealed and seem to play an important role for the observed unfolding pathway.",
"Kinetic energy definition in velocity Verlet integration for accurate pressure evaluation

DOI: http://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/16

In molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, a proper definition of kinetic energy is essential for controlling pressure as well as temperature in the isothermal-isobaric condition. The virial theorem provides an equation that connects the average kinetic energy with the product of particle coordinate and force. In this paper, we show that the theorem is satisfied in MD simulations with a larger time step and holonomic constraints of bonds, only when a proper definition of kinetic energy is used. We provide a novel definition of kinetic energy, which is calculated from velocities at the half-time steps (t  ∆t/ 2 and t + ∆t/ 2) in the velocity Verlet integration method. MD simulations of a 1,2-dispalmitoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) lipid bilayer and a water box using the kinetic energy definition could reproduce the physical properties in the isothermal-isobaric condition properly. We also develop a multiple time step (MTS) integration scheme with the kinetic energy definition. MD simulations with the MTS integration for the DPPC and water box systems provided the same quantities as the velocity Verlet integration method, even when the thermostat and barostat are updated less frequently.","Title: Crowding and pausing strongly affect dynamics of kinesin-1 motors along microtubules, Authors: Matthias Rank and Erwin Frey, Journal: arXiv, Reference: arXiv:1805.03432, Publication: May 9, 2018, Abstract: Molecular motors of the kinesin-1 family move in a directed and processive fashion along microtubules (MTs). It is generally accepted that steric hindrance of motors leads to crowding effects; however, little is known about the specific interactions involved. We employ an agent-based lattice gas model to study the impact of interactions which enhance the detachment of motors from crowded filaments on their collective dynamics. The predictions of our model quantitatively agree with the experimentally observed concentration dependence of key motor characteristics including their run length, dwell time, velocity, and landing rate. From the anomalous stepping statistics of individual motors which exhibit relatively long pauses we infer that kinesin-1 motors sometimes lapse into an inactive state. Hereby, the formation of traffic jams amplifies the impact of single inactive motors and leads to a crowding dependence of the frequencies and durations of the resulting periods of no or slow motion. We interpret these findings and conclude that kinesin-1 spends a significant fraction of its stepping cycle in a weakly bound state in which only one of its heads is bound to the MT.","Membrane curvature sensing by amphipathic helices: insights from implicit membrane modeling
Binod Nepal, John Leveritt III, Themis Lazaridis
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2018.03.030

Sensing and generation of lipid membrane curvature, mediated by the binding of specific proteins onto the membrane surface, play crucial roles in cell biology. A number of mechanisms have been proposed, but the molecular understanding of these processes is incomplete. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations have offered valuable insights but are extremely demanding computationally. Implicit membrane simulations could provide a viable alternative, but current models apply only to planar membranes. In this work, the implicit membrane model 1 is extended to spherical and tubular membranes. The geometric change from planar to curved shapes is straightforward but insufficient for capturing the full curvature effect, which includes changes in lipid packing. Here, these packing effects are taken into account via the lateral pressure profile. The extended implicit membrane model 1 is tested on the wild-types and mutants of the antimicrobial peptide magainin, the ALPS motif of arfgap1, α-synuclein, and an ENTH domain. In these systems, the model is in qualitative agreement with experiments. We confirm that favorable electrostatic interactions tend to weaken curvature sensitivity in the presence of strong hydrophobic interactions but may actually have a positive effect when those are weak. We also find that binding to vesicles is more favorable than binding to tubes of the same diameter and that the long helix of α-synuclein tends to orient along the axis of tubes, whereas shorter helices tend to orient perpendicular to it. Adoption of a specific orientation could provide a mechanism for coupling protein oligomerization to tubule formation. ","Title: The folding pathways and thermodynamics of semiflexible polymers, Authors: Jing Wu, Chenqian Cheng, Gaoyuan Liu and Tao Chen, Journal: Journal of Chemical Physics, Publication date: May 2018, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5018114, Abstract: Inspired by the protein folding and DNA packing, we have systematically studied the thermodynamic and kinetic behaviors of single semiflexible homopolymers by Langevin dynamics simulations. In line with experiments, a rich variety of folding products, such as rod-like bundles, hairpins, toroids, and a mixture of them, are observed in the complete diagram of states. Moreover, knotted structures with a significant population are found in a certain range of bending stiffness in thermal equilibrium. As the solvent quality becomes poorer, the population of the intermediate occurring in the folding process increases, which leads to a severe chevron rollover for the folding arm. However, the population of the intermediates in the unfolding process is very low, insufficient to induce unfolding arm rollover. The total types of folding pathways from the coil state to the toroidal state for a semiflexible polymer chain remain unchanged by varying the solvent quality or temperature, whereas the kinetic partitioning into different folding events can be tuned significantly. In the process of knotting, three types of mechanisms, namely, plugging, slipknotting, and sliding, are discovered. Along the folding evolution, a semiflexible homopolymer chain can knot at any stage of folding upon leaving the extended coil state, and the probability to find a knot increases with chain compactness. In addition, we find rich types of knotted topologies during the folding of a semiflexible homopolymer chain. This study should be helpful in gaining insight into the general principles of biopolymer folding.",

Abstract        
Collective variables are much used in many enhanced sampling methods and their choice is a crucial factor in determining sampling efficiency. However, at times searching for good collective variables can be challenging. In a recent paper, we combined time-lagged independent component analysis with well-tempered metadynamics in order to obtain improved collective variables from metadynamics runs that use lower quality collective variables [McCarty & Parrinello. J. Chem. Phys. 2017, 147, 204109]. In this work, we extend these ideas to variational enhanced sampling. This leads to an efficient scheme that is able to make use of the many advantages the variational scheme. We apply the method to alanine-3 in water. From an alanine-3 variational enhanced sampling trajectory in which all the six dihedral angles are biased, we extract much better collective variables able to describe in exquisite detail the protein complex free energy surface in a low dimensional representations. The success of this investigation is helped by a more accurate way of calculating the correlation functions needed in the time-lagged independent component analysis and from the introduction of a new basis set to describe the dihedral angles arrangement.
","On-the-Fly Specifications of Reaction Coordinates in Parallel Cascade Selection Molecular Dynamics Accelerate Conformational Transitions of Proteins
Ryuhei Harada and Yasuteru Shigeta
Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation Just Accepted Manuscript
DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00264 
Parallel Cascade Selection Molecular Dynamics (PaCS-MD) is an efficient conformational sampling method for generating a set of reactive trajectories that connect a given reactant and a product. In PaCS-MD, initial structures relevant to conformational transitions are reasonably selected by referring to a set of reaction coordinates (RCs), and short-time molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are independently launched from them. To efficiently perform PaCS-MD, specifications of RCs are essential but specifying reasonable RCs is generally non-trivial. In the present study, we propose on-the-fly specifications of RCs as an extended PaCS-MD. In the present method, n types of RCs are provided as candidates a priori as follow: RC = (X1, X2, …, Xn), and one of RCs is specified as a cycle-dependent manner, i.e. the reasonable RC is searched at every cycle by evaluating gradients of RCs, i.e. RC with the steepest gradient for cycle is regarded as the reasonable RC, and conformational resampling is proceeded along it, promoting conformational transition of a given protein. For a demonstration, the extended PaCS-MD was applied to reproduce the open-closed conformational transition of T4 lysozyme (T4L). As candidates of possible RCs, (1) root-mean square distance, (2) principal coordinates, (3) accessible surface area, (4) radius of gyration, and end-to-end distance were adopted in the cycle-dependent specifications of RCs. Through the demonstration, the extended PaCS-MD successfully reproduced the conformational transition from the open to closed states of T4L. As a more complicated practice, a dimerization process of di-ubiquitin was efficiently reproduced with the extended PaCS-MD, showing the high conformational sampling efficiency of the present algorithm. In contrast, the conventional PaCS-MD with a fixed RC sometimes failed to generate a set of reactive trajectories when an unreasonable RC was specified, i.e. the conformational sampling efficiency of PaCS-MD might more or less depend on the specified 
RCs. Judging from the present demonstrations, on-the-fly specifications of RCs might be effective to reproduce/predict essential transitions of a given protein.

Anharmonicity in time-dependent conformational fluctuations is noted to be a key feature of functional dynamics of biomolecules. Although anharmonic events are rare, long-timescale (μs–ms and beyond) simulations facilitate probing of such events. We have previously developed quasi-anharmonic analysis to resolve higher-order spatial correlations and characterize anharmonicity in biomolecular simulations. In this article, we have extended this toolbox to resolve higher-order temporal correlations and built a scalable Python package called anharmonic conformational analysis (ANCA). ANCA has modules to: 1) measure anharmonicity in the form of higher-order statistics and its variation as a function of time, 2) output a storyboard representation of the simulations to identify key anharmonic conformational events, and 3) identify putative anharmonic conformational substates and visualization of transitions between these substates.","Title: The membrane-induced pKa shifts in wt-pHLIP and its L16H variant, Authors: Diogo Vila-Viçosa, Tomás F. D. Silva, Gregory Slaybaugh, Yana K. Reshetnyak, Oleg A. Andreev, and Miguel Machuqueiro, Journal: Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation, Publication date: May 2018, DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00102, Abstract: The pH (low) insertion peptides (pHLIPs) is a family of peptides that are able to insert into a lipid bilayer at acidic pH. The molecular mechanism of pHLIPs insertion, folding, and stability in the membrane at low pH is based on multiple protonation events, which are challenging to study at the molecular level. More specifically, the relation between the experimental pK of insertion (pKexp) of pHLIPs and the pKa of the key residues is yet to be clarified. We carried out a computational study, complemented with new experimental data, and established the influence of (de)protonation of titrable residues on the stability of the peptide membrane-inserted state. Constant-pH molecular dynamics simulations were employed to calculate the pKa values of these residues along the membrane normal. In the wt-pHLIP, we identified Asp14 as the key residue for the stability of the membrane-inserted state, and its pKa value is strongly correlated with the experimental pKexp measured in thermodynamics studies. Also, in order to narrow down the pH range at which pHLIP is stable in the membrane, we designed a new pHLIP variant, L16H, where Leu in the 16th position was replaced by a titrable His residue. Our results showed that the L16H variant undergoes two transitions. The calculated pKa and experimentally observed pKexp values are in good agreement. Two distinct pKexp values delimit a pH range where the L16H peptide is stably inserted in the membrane, while, outside this range, the membrane-inserted state is destabilized and the peptide exits from the bilayer. pHLIP peptides have been successfully used to target cancer cells for the delivery of diagnostics and therapeutic agents to acidic tumors. The fine-tuning of the stability of the pHLIP inserted state and its restriction to a narrow well-defined pH range might allow the design of new peptides, able to discriminate between tissues with different extracellular pH values.",

Abstract
One of the many peculiar properties of water is the pronounced deviation of the proton momentum distribution from Maxwell-Boltzmann behaviour. This deviation from the classical limit is a manifestation of the quantum mechanical nature of protons. Its extent, which can be probed directly by Deep Inelastic Neutron Scattering (DINS) experiments, gives important insight on the potential of mean force felt by H atoms. The determination of the full distribution of particle momenta, however, is a real tour de force for both experiments and theory, which has led to unresolved discrepancies between the two. In this Letter we present comprehensive, fully-converged momentum distributions for water at several thermodynamic state points, focusing on the components that cannot be described in terms of a scalar contribution to the quantum kinetic energy, and providing a benchmark that can serve as a reference for future simulations and experiments. In doing so, we also introduce a number of technical developments that simplify and accelerate greatly the calculation of momentum distributions by means of atomistic simulations.
","Molecular dynamics simulations using the drude polarizable force field on GPUs with OpenMM: Implementation, validation, and benchmarks
J. Huang, J. A. Lemkul, P. K. Eastman, A. D. MacKerell. J. Comput. Chem. 2018, DOI:10.1002/jcc.25339
Presented is the implementation of the Drude force field in the open‐source OpenMM simulation package allowing for access to graphical processing unit (GPU) hardware. In the Drude model, electronic degrees of freedom are represented by negatively charged particles attached to their parent atoms via harmonic springs, such that extra computational overhead comes from these additional particles and virtual sites representing lone pairs on electronegative atoms, as well as the associated thermostat and integration algorithms. This leads to an approximately fourfold increase in computational demand over additive force fields. However, by making the Drude model accessible to consumer‐grade desktop GPU hardware it will be possible to perform simulations of one microsecond or more in less than a month, indicating that the barrier to employ polarizable models has largely been removed such that polarizable simulations with the classical Drude model are readily accessible and practical.","Quantitative characterization of cholesterol partitioning between binary bilayers

DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00140

We have devised a practical simulation protocol for quantitative characterization of cholesterol (Chol) partitioning between bilayers with different lipid types. The simulation model contains two patches of laterally contacting lipid bilayers, where the host lipids of each bilayer are allowed to self-adjust their packing. For two combinations of bilayers with different lipid types, 1,2-dioleoyl-snglycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC)/1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3- phosphocholine (POPC) and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC), the simulation model has been verified by selfadjusted lipid packing in each bilayer, convergence of Chol partitioning between different Chol initial distributions, and relative diffusion coefficients consistent to those from experiments. The calculated Chol partition coefficient between POPC and DOPC bilayers from the Chol partitioning simulations in the POPC-DPPC and DOPC-DPPC binary bilayer systems shows an excellent agreement with that from available Chol exchange experiments between 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine- (SOPC)/DOPC vesicles and β-cyclodextrins, which further validates the simulation protocol and illustrates its applicability to any molecular partitioning in the binary bilayer system.
","Title: Electroporation of Skin Stratum Corneum Lipid Bilayer and Molecular Mechanism of Drug Transport: A Molecular Dynamics Study, Authors: Rakesh Gupta and Beena Rai, Journal: Langmuir, 2018, 34: 5860-5870, Abstract: The electroporation technique has been used significantly to increase drug permeation through the skin. This technique relies on the application of short-timed (microseconds to millisecond) electric fields (generally, order of 50−-300 V) on the skin to create microscopic pores. However, the molecular mechanism of pore formation, resulting in an enhanced flux of active molecules through the skin, remains poorly understood. In this study, extensive atomistic molecular dynamics simulation of skin lipids [made up of ceramide (CER), cholesterol (CHOL), and free fatty acid (FFA)] has been performed at various external electric fields. We show for the first time the pore formation in the skin lipid bilayer during electroporation. We show the effect of the applied external electrical field (0.6–1.0 V/nm) on the pore formation dynamics in the lipid bilayer of different sizes (154, 616, and 2464 lipids) and compositions (CER/CHOL/FFA, 1:0:0, 1:0:1, 1:1:0, 1:1:1). The pore formation and resealing kinetics were different and were found to be highly dependent on the composition of the skin lipid bilayer. The pore formation time decreased with increase in the bilayer size. The pore sustaining electric field was found to be in the range of 0.20–0.25 V/nm for equimolar CER, CHOL, and FFA lipid bilayers. The skin lipid bilayer (1:1:1) sealed itself within 20 ns after the removal of the external electric field. We also present the molecular mechanism of enhancement of drug permeation in the presence of external field as compared to the passive diffusion. The molecular-level understanding obtained here could help in optimizing/designing the electroporation experiments for effective drug delivery. For a given skin composition and size of the drug molecule, the combination of pore formation time and pore growth model can be used to know a priori the desired electric field and time for the application of the electric field.",

Abstract
Molecular dynamics represents a key enabling technology for applications ranging from biology to development of new materials. However, many real-world applications remains inaccessible to fully-resolved simulations due their unsustainable computational costs and must therefore rely on semi-empirical coarse-grained models. Significant efforts have been devoted in the last decade towards improving the predictivity of these coarse-grained models and providing a rigorous justification of their use, through a combination of theoretical studies and data-driven approaches. One of the most promising research effort is the (re-)discovery of the Mori-Zwanzig projection as a generic, yet systematic, theoretical tool for deriving coarse-grained models. Despite its clean mathematical formulation and generality, there are still many open questions about its applicability and assumptions. In this work, we propose a detailed derivation of a hybrid multi-scale system, generalising and further investigating the approach developed in [Español, P., EPL, 88, 40008 (2009)]. Issues such as the general co-existence of atoms (fully-resolved degrees of freedom) and beads (larger coarse-grained units), the role of the fine-to-coarse mapping chosen, and the approximation of effective potentials are discussed. The concept of an approximate projection is introduced along with a discussion of its use as measure of the error committed with the approximation of the true interactions among the beads. The theoretical discussion is supported by numerical simulations of a monodimensional non-linear periodic benchmark system with an open-source parallel Julia code, easily extensible to arbitrary potential models and fine-to-coarse mapping functions. The results presented highlight the importance of introducing, in the macroscopic model, a non-constant dissipative term, given by the Mori-Zwanzig approach, to correctly reproduce the reference fine-grained results without requiring ad-hoc calibration of interaction potentials and thermostats.

Linking time-series of single-molecule experiments with molecular dynamics simulations by machine learning

DOI: 10.7554/eLife.32668 
 Single-molecule experiments and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are indispensable tools for investigating protein conformational dynamics. The former provide timeseries data, such as donor-acceptor distances, whereas the latter give atomistic information, although this information is often biased by model parameters. Here, we devise a machine-learning method to combine the complementary information from the two approaches and construct a consistent model of conformational dynamics. It is applied to the folding dynamics of the forminbinding protein WW domain. MD simulations over 400 ms led to an initial Markov state model (MSM), which was then ""refined"" using single-molecule Fo¨rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) data through hidden Markov modeling. The refined or data-assimilated MSM reproduces the FRET data and features hairpin one in the transition-state ensemble, consistent with mutation experiments. The folding pathway in the data-assimilated MSM suggests interplay between hydrophobic contacts and turn formation. Our method provides a general framework for investigating conformational transitions in other proteins. ","Forward-flux sampling with jumpy order parameters

Forward-flux sampling (FFS) is a path sampling technique that has gained increased popularity in recent years and has been used to compute rates of rare event phenomena such as crystallization, condensation, hydrophobic evaporation, DNA hybridization, and protein folding. The popularity of FFS is not only due to its ease of implementation but also because it is not very sensitive to the particular choice of an order parameter. The order parameter utilized in conventional FFS, however, still needs to satisfy a stringent smoothness criterion in order to assure sequential crossing of FFS milestones. This condition is usually violated for order parameters utilized for describing aggregation phenomena such as crystallization. Here, we present a generalized FFS algorithm for which this smoothness criterion is no longer necessary and apply it to compute homogeneous crystal nucleation rates in several systems. Our numerical tests reveal that conventional FFS can sometimes underestimate the nucleation rate by several orders of magnitude.","Title: Comparative analysis of membrane protein structure databases, Authors: Kentaro Shimizu, Wei Cao, Gull Saad, Michiru Shoji, Tohru Terada, Journal: Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Biomembranes, 2018, 1860: 1077-1091, Abstract: Membrane proteins play important roles in cell survival and cell communication, as they function as transporters, receptors, anchors and enzymes.

We compared and analyzed the widely used membrane protein databases, mpstruc, Orientations of Proteins in Membranes (OPM), and PDBTM, as well as the extended dataset of mpstruc based on sequence similarity, the PDB structures whose classification field indicates that they are “membrane proteins” and the proteins with Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) class-f domains. We evaluated the relationships between these databases or datasets based on the overlap in their contents and the degree of consistency in the structural, topological, and functional classifications and in the transmembrane domain assignment. The membrane databases differ from each other in their coverage, and in the criteria that they use for annotation and classification. To ensure the efficient use of these databases, it is important to understand their differences and similarities. The establishment of more detailed and consistent annotations for the sequence, structure, membrane association, and function of membrane proteins is still required. Considering the recent growth of experimentally determined structures, a broad survey and cumulative analysis of the sum of knowledge as presented in the membrane protein structure databases can be helpful to elucidate structures and functions of membrane proteins. We also aim to provide a framework for future research and classification of membrane proteins.",

Abstract        
A data-driven modeling scheme is proposed for conformational dynamics of biomolecules based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and experimental measurements. In this scheme, an initial Markov State Model (MSM) is constructed from MD simulation trajectories, and then, the MSM parameters are refined using experimental measurements through machine learning techniques. The second step can reduce the bias of MD simulation results due to inaccurate force-field parameters. Either time-series trajectories or ensemble-averaged data are available as a training data set in the scheme. Using a coarse-grained model of a dye-labeled polyproline-20, we compare the performance of machine learning estimations from the two types of training data sets. Machine learning from time-series data could provide the equilibrium populations of conformational states as well as their transition probabilities. It estimates hidden conformational states in more robust ways compared to that from ensemble-averaged data although there are limitations in estimating the transition probabilities between minor states. We discuss how to use the machine learning scheme for various experimental measurements including single-molecule time-series trajectories.

For a three-dimensional structure to sponta- neously self-assemble from many identical components, the steps on the pathway must be kinetically accessible. Many virus capsids are icosahedral and assembled from hundreds of identical proteins, but how they navigate the assembly process is poorly understood. Capsid assembly is thought to involve stepwise addition of subunits to a growing capsid fragment. Coarse-grained models suggest that the reaction occurs on a downhill energy landscape, so intermediates are expected to be fleeting. In this work, charge detection mass spectrometry (CDMS) has been used to track assembly of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) capsid in real time. The icosahedral T = 4 capsid of HBV is assembled from 120 capsid protein dimers. Our results indicate that there are multiple pathways for assembly. Under conditions that favor a modest association energy there is no accumulation of large intermediates, which indicates that available pathways include ones on a downhill energy surface. Under higher salt conditions, where subunit interactions are strengthened, around half of the products of the initial assembly reaction have masses close to the T = 4 capsid and the other half are stalled intermediates which emerge abruptly at around 90 dimers, indicating a bifurcation in the ensemble of assembly paths. When incubated at room temperature, the 90-dimer intermediates accumulate dimers and gradually shift to higher mass and merge with the capsid peak. Though free subunits are present in solution, the stalled intermediates indicate the presence of a local minima on the energy landscape. Some intermediates may result from hole closure, where the growing capsid distorts to close the hole due to the missing capsid proteins or from a species where subsequent additions are particularly labile.","Flexible selection of the solute region in replica exchange with solute tempering: Application to protein-folding simulations

Replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) and their variants have been widely used in simulations of the biomolecular structure and dynamics. Replica exchange with solute tempering (REST) is one of the methods where temperature of a pre-defined solute molecule is exchanged between replicas, while solvent temperatures in all the replicas are kept constant. REST greatly reduces the number of replicas compared to the temperature REMD, while replicas at low temperatures are often trapped under their conditions, interfering with the conformational sampling. Here, we introduce a new scheme of REST, referred to as generalized REST (gREST), where the solute region is defined as a part of a molecule or a part of the potential energy terms, such as the dihedral-angle energy term or Lennard-Jones energy term. We applied this new method to folding simulations of a β-hairpin (16 residues) and a Trp-cage (20 residues) in explicit water. The protein dihedral-angle energy term is chosen as the solute region in the simula tions. gREST reduces the number of replicas necessary for good random walks in the solute-temperature space and covers a wider conformational space compared to the conventional REST2. Considering the general applicability, gREST should become a promising tool for the simulations of protein folding, conformational dynamics, and an in silico drug design.","Title: Hydronium Ions Accompanying Buried Acidic Residues Lead to High Apparent Dielectric Constants in the Interior of Proteins, Authors: Xiongwu Wu and Bernard R. Brooks, Journal: Journal of Physical Chemistry B, DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b04584, Abstract: Internal ionizable groups are known to play important roles in protein functions. A mystery that has attracted decades of extensive experimental and theoretical studies is the apparent dielectric constants experienced by buried ionizable groups, which are much higher than values expected for protein interiors. Many interpretations have been proposed, such as water penetration, conformational relaxation, local unfolding, protein intrinsic backbone fluctuations, etc. However, these interpretations conflict with many experimental observations. The virtual mixture of multiple states (VMMS) simulation method developed in our lab provides a direct approach for studying the equilibrium of multiple chemical states and can monitor pKa values along simulation trajectories. Through VMMS simulations of staphylococcal nuclease (SNase) variants with internal Asp or Glu residues, we discovered that cations were attracted to buried deprotonated acidic groups and the presence of the nearby cations were essential to reproduce experimentally measured pKa values. This finding, combined with structural analysis and validation simulations, suggests that the proton released from a deprotonation process stays near the deprotonated group inside proteins, possibly in the form of a hydronium ion. The existence of a proton near a buried charge has many implications in our understanding of protein functions.",

Abstract
Collective migration dominates many phenomena, from cell movement in living systems to abiotic selfpropelling particles. Focusing on the early stages of tumor evolution, we enunciate the principles involved in cell dynamics and highlight their implications in understanding similar behavior in seemingly unrelated soft glassy materials and possibly chemokine-induced migration of CD8+T cells. We performed simulations of tumor invasion using a minimal three-dimensional model, accounting for cell elasticity and adhesive cell-cell interactions, as well as cell birth and death, to establish that cell-growth-ratedependent tumor expansion results in the emergence of distinct topological niches. Cells at the periphery move with higher velocity perpendicular to the tumor boundary, while the motion of interior cells is slower and isotropic. The mean-square displacement Δ(t) of cells exhibits glassy behavior at times comparable to the cell cycle time, while exhibiting superdiffusive behavior, Δ(t) ≈ t^α (α > 1), at longer times. We derive the value of α ≈ 1.33 using a field theoretic approach based on stochastic quantization. In the process, we establish the universality of superdiffusion in a class of seemingly unrelated nonequilibrium systems. Superdiffusion at long times arises only if there is an imbalance between cell birth and death rates. Our findings for the collective migration, which also suggest that tumor evolution occurs in a polarized manner, are in quantitative agreement with in vitro experiments. Although set in the context of tumor invasion, the findings should also hold in describing the collective motion in growing cells and in active systems, where creation and annihilation of particles play a role.

RIG-I is a viral RNA sensor that induces the production of type I interferon (IFN) in response to infection with a variety of viruses. Modification of RIG-I with K63-linked poly-ubiquitin chains, synthesised by TRIM25, is crucial for activation of the RIG-I/MAVS signalling path-way. TRIM25 activity is targeted by influenza A virus non-structural protein 1 (NS1) to suppress IFN production and prevent an efficient host immune response. Here we present structures of the human TRIM25 coiled-coil-PRYSPRY module and of complexes between the TRIM25 coiled-coil domain and NS1. These structures show that binding of NS1 interferes with the correct positioning of the PRYSPRY domain of TRIM25 required for substrate ubi-quitination and provide a mechanistic explanation for how NS1 suppresses RIG-I ubiquiti-nation and hence downstream signalling. In contrast, the formation of unanchored K63-linked poly-ubiquitin chains is unchanged by NS1 binding, indicating that RING dimerisation of TRIM25 is not affected by NS1.","1.

Abstract        
The role that van der Waals (vdW) attractive forces play in the hydration and association of atomic hydrophobic solutes like argon (Ar) in water is reanalyzed using the local molecular field (LMF) theory of those interactions. In this problem, solute vdW attractive forces can reduce or mask hydrophobic interactions as measured by contact peak heights of the ArAr correlation function compared to reference results for purely repulsive core solutes. Nevertheless, both systems exhibit characteristic hydrophobic inverse temperature behavior in which hydrophobic association become stronger with increasing temperature through a moderate temperature range. The new theoretical approximation obtained here is remarkably simple and faithful to the statistical mechanical LMF assessment of the necessary force balance. Our results extend and significantly revise approximations made in a recent application of the LMF approach to this problem, and, unexpectedly, support a theory of nearly 40 years ago.","Effect of Cholesterol on Membrane Dipole Potential: Atomistic and Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics Simulations.

The effect of cholesterol on membrane dipole potential has been the subject of a great number of experimental and theoretical investigations, but these studies have yielded different findings and interpretations at high cholesterol concentrations. This suggests that the underlying mechanism of the cholesterol effect is not well addressed. Moreover, as far as we know, none of the previously proposed coarse-grained (CG) models (including MARTINI and its improved versions) has been successfully used to probe the effect of cholesterol on membrane dipole potential, owing to either an inaccurate description of water-cholesterol electrostatics or the neglect of the contribution of cholesterol to membrane dipole potential. In our previous works, we proposed a CG model CAVS (charge attached to virtual site) for lipid and water, showing the advantage of the CAVS model in the calculations of membrane dipole potential as compared to the MARTINI model. In this work, we present the CAVS model for cholesterol in order to enable us to investigate the effect of cholesterol on membrane dipole potential at large spatial scale. Our works showed that the CAVS and CHARMM models produced similar results in the study of the effects of cholesterol on lipid bilayer structures and membrane dipole potential. In particular, by combining the CHARMM and CAVS simulations, we explicitly calculated the individual contributions of membrane components (cholesterol, water, and lipid) to membrane dipole potential at different cholesterol concentrations, and we discovered that an increase in cholesterol content would result in a non-linear variation of the individual contributions of water and lipid with cholesterol concentration. On the other side, we observed that the individual contribution of cholesterol to membrane dipole potential would non-linearly increase with increasing cholesterol concentration. Thus, the effect of cholesterol on membrane dipole potential is complicated owing to the different variation of individual contributions of membrane components (water, lipid, and cholesterol) with cholesterol concentration.",

Abstract: We perform ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation of liquid water in the canonical ensemble at ambient conditions using the strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) meta-generalized-gradient approximation (GGA) functional approximation and carry out system- atic comparisons with the results obtained from the GGA-level Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional and Tkatchenko-Scheffler van der Waals (vdW) dispersion correction inclusive PBE functional. We analyze various properties of liquid water including radial distribution functions, oxygen-oxygen-oxygen triplet angular distribution, tetrahedrality, hydrogen bonds, diffusion coef- ficients, ring statistics, density of states, band gaps, and dipole moments. We find that the SCAN functional is generally more accurate than the other two functionals for liquid water by not only cap- turing the intermediate-range vdW interactions but also mitigating the overly strong hydrogen bonds prescribed in PBE simulations. We also compare the results of SCAN-based AIMD simulations in the canonical and isothermal-isobaric ensembles. Our results suggest that SCAN provides a reliable description for most structural, electronic, and dynamical properties in liquid water. 
","Radicchi, F., and C. Castellano. 2018. Uncertainty Reduction for Stochastic Processes on Complex Networks. Phys. Rev. Lett. 120: 198301.

Many real-world systems are characterized by stochastic dynamical rules where a complex network of interactions among individual elements probabilistically determines their state. Even with full knowledge of the network structure and of the stochastic rules, the ability to predict system configurations is generally characterized by a large uncertainty. Selecting a fraction of the nodes and observing their state may help to reduce the uncertainty about the unobserved nodes. However, choosing these points of observation in an optimal way is a highly nontrivial task, depending on the nature of the stochastic process and on the structure of the underlying interaction pattern. In this paper, we introduce a computationally efficient algorithm to determine quasioptimal solutions to the problem. The method leverages network sparsity to reduce computational complexity from exponential to almost quadratic, thus allowing the straightforward application of the method to mid-to-large-size systems. Although the method is exact only for equilibrium stochastic processes defined on trees, it turns out to be effective also for out-of-equilibrium processes on sparse loopy networks.","2.

Abstract
Prediction of membrane permeability to small molecules represents an important aspect of drug discovery. First-principle calculations of this quantity require an accurate description of both the thermodynamics and kinetics that underlie translocation of the permeant across the lipid bilayer. In this contribution, the membrane permeability to three drugs, or drug-like molecules, namely, 9-anthroic acid (ANA), 2',3'-dideoxyadenosine (DDA) and hydrocortisone (HYL) are estimated in a pure 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) and in a POPC:cholesterol (2:1) mixture. On the basis of independent 2-5-μs free-energy calculations combined with a time-fractional Smoluchowski determination of the diffusivity, the estimated membrane permeabilities to these chemically diverse permeants fall within an order of magnitude from the experimental values obtained in egg lecithin bilayers, with the exception of HYL in pure POPC. This exception is particularly interesting because the calculated permeability of the sterol-rich bilayer to HYL, in close agreement with the experimental value, is about 600 times lower than that of the pure POPC bilayer to HYL. In contrast, the permeabilities to ANA and DDA differ by less than a factor of ten between the pure POPC and POPC:cholesterol bilayers, although the trend of a lower permeability in the sterol-rich bilayer holds for all permeants. The unusual behavior of HYL, a large, amphiphilic compound, may be linked with the longer-range perturbation of the lipid bilayer it induces, compared to ANA and DDA, suggestive of a possibly different translocation mechanism. We find that the tendency of lower permeabilities of the POPC:cholesterol bilayer relative to those of the pure POPC one is a consequence of increased free-energy barriers. Beyond reporting accurate estimates of the membrane permeability, the present contribution also demonstrates that rigorous free-energy calculations and a fractional-diffusion model are key in revealing the molecular phenomena linking the composition of a membrane to its permeability to drugs.
","Stability of Membrane-Induced Self-Assemblies of Spherical Nanoparticles. Eric J Spangler,  Sunil Kumar P. B.  and  Mohamed Laradji. Soft Matter. Accepted Manuscript. DOI: 10.1039/C8SM00537K

The self-assembly of spherical nanoparticles, resulting from their adhesion on tensionless lipid membranes, is investigated through molecular dynamics simulations of a coarse-grained implicit-solvent model for self-assembled lipid membranes. Our simulations indicate that, with increasing adhesion strength, while reshaping the membrane, the nanoparticles aggregate into a sequence of self-assemblies corresponding to in-plane chains, two-row tubular (bitube) chains, annular (ring) chains, and single-row tubular (tube) chains. Annealing scans, with respect to adhesion strength, show that the transitions between the various phases are highly first-order with significant hystereses. Free energy calculations indicate that the gas and single-row tubular chains are stable over wide ranges of adhesion strength. In contrast, the in-plane chains are only stable for small aggregates of NPs, and the bitube and ring chains are long-lived metastable states over a wide range of adhesion strength.",

Abstract: The large and sparsely hydrated thiocyanate anion, SCN–, plays a prominent role in the study of specific ion effects in biological, colloid, and atmospheric chemistry due to its extreme position in the Hofmeister series. Using atomistic modeling of aqueous SCN– solutions, we provide novel insight at the molecular scale into the experimentally observed differences in ion pairing, clustering, reorientation dynamics, mutual diffusion, and solubility between the sodium, Na+, and the potassium, K+, salt. Compared to KSCN, NaSCN has a less pronounced tendency to ion pairing; nevertheless, at high salt concentrations, we observe a strong attraction between Na+cations and the nitrogen end of SCN–, resulting in larger and more closely packed ion clusters. To accurately model aqueous SCN– solutions in computer simulations, we develop a thermodynamically consistent force field rooted in quantum-chemical calculations and refined using the Kirkwood–Buff theory. The force field is compatible with the extended simple point charge and three-point optimal point charge classical water models and reproduces experimental activity derivatives and air–water surface tension for a wide range of salt concentrations.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are widely-occurring host defense agents, of interest as one route for addressing the growing problem of multidrug-resistant pathogens. Understanding the mechanisms behind their anti-pathogen activity is instrumental in designing new AMPs. Herein, we present an all-atom molecular dynamics and free energy study on cecropin B (CB), and its constituent domains. We find a cooperative mechanism in which CB inserts into an anionic model membrane with its amphipathic N-terminal segment, supported by the hydrophobic C-terminal segment of a second peptide. The two peptides interact via a Glu…Lys salt bridge, and together sustain a pore in the membrane. Using a modified membrane composition, we demonstrate that when the lower leaflet is overall neutral, insertion of the cationic segment is retarded, and thus this mode of action is membrane specific. The observed mode of action utilizes a flexible hinge, a common structural motif among AMPs, which allows CB to insert into the membrane using either or both termini. Data from both unbiased trajectories and enhanced sampling simulations indicate that a requirement for CB to be an effective AMP is the interaction of its hydrophobic C-terminal segment with the membrane. Simulations of these segments in isolation reveal their aggregation in the membrane, and a different mechanism of supporting pore formation. Together, our results show the complex interaction of different structural motifs of AMPs, and in particular an important role for anionic side chains in an overall cationic AMP.

Abstract
How does the mathematical description of a system change in different reference frames? Galilei first addressed this fundamental question by formulating the famous principle of Galilean invariance. It prescribes that the equations of motion of closed systems remain the same in different inertial frames related by Galilean transformations, thus imposing strong constraints on the dynamical rules. However, real world systems are often described by coarse-grained models integrating complex internal and external interactions indistinguishably as friction and stochastic forces. Since Galilean invariance is then violated, there is seemingly no alternative principle to assess a priori the physical consistency of a given stochastic model in different inertial frames. Here, starting from the Kac–Zwanzig Hamiltonian model generating Brownian motion, we show how Galilean invariance is broken during the coarse-graining procedure when deriving stochastic equations. Our analysis leads to a set of rules characterizing systems in different inertial frames that have to be satisfied by general stochastic models, which we call “weak Galilean invariance.” Several well-known stochastic processes are invariant in these terms, except the continuous-time random walk for which we derive the correct invariant description. Our results are particularly relevant for the modeling of biological systems, as they provide a theoretical principle to select physically consistent stochastic models before a validation against experimental data.

Machine learning (ML) based prediction of molecular properties across chemical compound space is an important and alternative approach to efficiently estimate the solutions of highly complex many-electron problems in chemistry and physics. Statistical methods represent molecules as descriptors that should encode molecular symmetries and interactions between atoms. Many such descriptors have been proposed; all of them have advantages and limitations. Here, we propose a set of general two-body and three-body interaction descriptors which are invariant to translation, rotation and atomic indexing. By adapting the successfully used kernel ridge regression methods of machine learning, we evaluate our descriptors on predicting several properties of small organic molecules calculated using density-functional theory. We use two datasets. The GDB-7 set contains 6868 molecules with up to 7 heavy atoms of type CNO. The GDB-9 set is composed of 131722 molecules with up to 9 heavy atoms containing CNO. When trained on 5000 random molecules, our best model achieves an accuracy of 0.8 kcal/mol (on the remaining 1868 molecules of GDB-7) and 1.5 kcal/mol (on the remaining 126722 molecules of GDB-9) respectively. Applying a linear regression model on our novel many-body descriptors performs almost equal to a non-linear kernelized model. Linear models are readily interpretable: a feature importance ranking measure helps to obtain qualitative and quantitative insights on the importance of two and three-body molecular interactions for predicting molecular properties computed with quantum-mechanical methods.

Abstract: The present work introduces a novel approach for obtaining reduced chemistry representations of large kinetic mechanisms in strong non-equilibrium conditions. The need for accurate reduced-order models arises from compression of large ab initio quantum chemistry databases for their use in fluid codes. The method presented in this paper builds on existing physics-based strategies and proposes a new approach based on the combination of a simple coarse grain model with Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The internal energy levels of the chemical species are regrouped in distinct energy groups with a uniform lumping technique. Following the philosophy of machine learning, PCA is applied on the training data provided by the coarse grain model to find an optimally reduced representation of the full kinetic mechanism. Compared to recently published complex lumping strategies, no expert judgment is required before the application of PCA. In this work, we will demonstrate the benefits of the combined approach, stressing its simplicity, reliability, and accuracy. The technique is demonstrated by reducing the complex quantum N2(Σg+1)–N(Su4)N2(Σg+1)–N(Su4) database for studying molecular dissociation and excitation in strong non-equilibrium. Starting from detailed kinetics, an accurate reduced model is developed and used to study non-equilibrium properties of the N2(Σg+1)–N(Su4)N2(Σg+1)–N(Su4) system in shock relaxation simulations.

Developing temperature transferable coarse-grained (CG) models is essential for the computational prediction of polymeric glass-forming (GF) material behavior, but their dynamics are often greatly altered from those of all-atom (AA) models mainly because of the reduced fluid configurational entropy under coarse-graining. To address this issue, we have recently introduced an energy renormalization (ER) strategy that corrects the activation free energy of the CG polymer model by renormalizing the cohesive interaction strength ε as a function of temperature T, i.e., ε(T), thus semiempirically preserving the T-dependent dynamics of the AA model. Here we apply our ER method to consider—in addition to T-dependency—the frequency f-dependent polymer viscoelasticity. Through small-amplitude oscillatory shear molecular dynamics simulations, we show that changing the imposed oscillation f on the CG systems requires changes in ε values (i.e., ε(T, f)) to reproduce the AA viscoelasticity. By accounting for the dynamic fragility of polymers as a material parameter, we are able to predict ε(T, f) under coarse-graining in order to capture the AA viscoelasticity, and consequently the activation energy, across a wide range of T and f in the GF regime. Specifically, we showcase our achievements on two representative polymers of distinct fragilities, polybutadiene (PB) and polystyrene (PS), and show that our CG models are able to sample viscoelasticity up to the megahertz regime, which approaches state-of-the-art experimental resolutions, and capture results sampled via AA simulations and prior experiments.

Abstract        
We derive the distribution function for particle currents for a system of interacting active Brownian particles in the long time limit using large deviation theory and a weighted many body expansion. We find the distribution is non-Gaussian, except in the limit of passive particles. The non-Gaussian fluctuations can be understood from the effective potential the particles experience when conditioned on a given current. This potential suppresses fluctuations of the particle's orientation, and reduces the drag opposing self-propulsion. From the distribution of currents, we compute the diffusion coefficient, which is in excellent agreement with molecular dynamics simulations over a range of self-propulsion velocities and densities. We show that mass transport is Fickian in that the diffusion constant determines the response of a small density gradient, and that nonlinear responses are similarly computable from the density dependence of the current distribution.

We investigated the molecular dynamics of unilamellar liposomes by neutron spin echo spectroscopy. We report the first experimental evidence of a short-range motion at the length scale of the size of the headgroup of a lipid. The associated mean squared displacement shows a t0.26 dependence in the pico- to nanosecond region that indicates another process beyond the predictions of the Zilman–Granek (ZG) model (t0.66) and translational diffusion (t1). A comparison with theory shows that the observed low exponent is associated with a non-Gaussian transient trapping of lipid molecules in a local area and supports the continuous time random walk model. The analysis of the mean squared displacement leads to the important conclusion that the friction at the interface between water and liposomes plays a minor role. Center of mass diffusion of liposomes and transient trapping of lipids define the range in which the ZG model can be applied to analyze membrane fluctuations",
"Adaptive landscape flattening in amino acid sequence space for the computational design of protein:peptide binding

Francesco Villa, Nicolas Panel, Xingyu Chen, and Thomas Simonson

For the high throughput design of protein:peptide binding, one must explore a vast space of amino acid sequences in search of low binding free energies. This complex problem is usually addressed with either simple heuristic scoring or expensive sequence enumeration schemes. Far more efficient than enumeration is a recent Monte Carlo approach that adaptively flattens the energy landscape in sequence space of the unbound peptide and provides formally exact binding free energy differences. The method allows the binding free energy to be used directly as the design criterion. We propose several improvements that allow still more efficient sampling and can address larger design problems. They include the use of Replica Exchange Monte Carlo and landscape flattening for both the unbound and bound peptides. We used the method to design peptides that bind to the PDZ domain of the Tiam1 signaling protein and could serve as inhibitors of its activity. Four peptide positions were allowed to mutate freely. Almost 75 000 peptide variants were processed in two simulations of 109 steps each that used 1 CPU hour on a desktop machine. 96% of the theoretical sequence space was sampled. The relative binding free energies agreed qualitatively with values from experiment. The sampled sequences agreed qualitatively with an experimental library of Tiam1-binding peptides. The main assumption limiting accuracy is the fixed backbone approximation, which could be alleviated in future work by using increased computational resources and multi-backbone designs.","Bilayer Thickness and Curvature Influence Binding and Insertion of a pHLIP Peptide

The physical properties of lipid bilayers, such as curvature and fluidity, can affect the interactions of polypeptides with membranes, influencing biological events. Additionally, given the growing interest in peptide-based therapeutics, understanding the influence of membrane properties on membrane-associated peptides has potential utility. pH low insertion peptides (pHLIPs) are a family of water-soluble peptides that can insert across cell membranes in a pH-dependent manner, enabling the use of pH to follow peptide-lipid interactions. Here we study pHLIP interactions with liposomes varying in size and composition, to determine the influence of several key membrane physical properties. We find that pHLIP binding to bilayer surfaces at neutral pH is governed by the ease of access to the membrane’s hydrophobic core, which can be facilitated by membrane curvature, thickness, and the cholesterol content of the membrane. After surface binding, if the pH is lowered, the kinetics of pHLIP folding to form a helix and subsequent insertion across the membrane depends on the fluidity and energetic dynamics of the membrane. We showed that pHLIP is capable of forming a helix across lipid bilayers of different thicknesses at low pH. However, the kinetics of the slow phase of insertion corresponding to the translocation of C-terminal end of the peptide across lipid bilayer, vary approximately twofold, and correlate with bilayer thickness and fluidity. Although these influences are not large, local curvature variations in membranes of different fluidity could selectively influence surface binding in mixed cell populations.

Abstract
Measuring the vibronic spectrum probes dynamical processes in molecular systems. When interpreted via suitable theoretical tools, the experimental data provides comprehensive information about the system in question. For complex many-body problems, such an approach usually requires the formulation of proper classical-like approximations, which is particularly challenging if multiple electronic states are involved. In this manuscript, we express the imaginary-time shifted time correlation function (TCF) and, thus, the vibronic spectrum in terms of the so-called Matsubara dynamics, which combines quantum statistics and classical-like dynamics. In contrast to the existing literature, we invoke a local harmonic approximation to the potential allowing an analytical evaluation of integrals. By subsequently applying the Matsubara approximation, we derive a generalization of the existing Matsubara method to multiple potential energy surfaces (PESs), which, however, suffers from the sign problem as its single-PES counterpart does. The mathematical analysis for two shifted harmonic oscillators suggests a new modified method to simulate the standard correlation function via classical-like dynamics. Importantly, this modified method samples the thermal Wigner function without suffering from the sign problem and it yields an accurate approximation to the vibronic absorption spectrum, not only for the harmonic system, but also for an anharmonic one.
","Local initiation conditions for water autoionization

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Apr 2018, 201714070; DOI:10.1073/pnas.1714070115
The pH of liquid water is determined by the infrequent process in which water molecules split into short-lived hydroxide and hydronium ions. This reaction is difficult to probe experimentally and challenging to simulate. One of the open questions is whether the local water structure around a slightly stretched OH bond is actually initiating the eventual breakage of this bond or whether this event is driven by a global ordering that involves many water molecules far away from the reaction center. Here, we investigated the self-ionization of water at room temperature by rare-event ab initio molecular dynamics and obtained autoionization rates and activation energies in good agreement with experiments. Based on the analysis of thousands of molecular trajectories, we identified a couple of local order parameters and show that if a bond stretch occurs when all these parameters are around their ideal range, the chance for the first dissociation step (double-proton jump) increases from 10−7 to 0.4. Understanding these initiation triggers might ultimately allow the steering of chemical reactions.",
"Open-Boundary Molecular Dynamics of a DNA Molecule in a Hybrid Explicit/Implicit Salt Solution

The composition and electrolyte concentration of the aqueous bathing environment have important consequences for many biological processes and can profoundly affect the behavior of biomolecules. Nevertheless, because of computational limitations, many molecular simulations of biophysical systems can be performed only at specific ionic conditions: either at nominally zero salt concentration, i.e., including only counterions enforcing the system’s electroneutrality, or at excessive salt concentrations. Here, we introduce an efficient molecular dynamics simulation approach for an atomistic DNA molecule at realistic physiological ionic conditions. The simulations are performed by employing the open-boundary molecular dynamics method that allows for simulation of open systems that can exchange mass and linear momentum with the environment. In our open-boundary molecular dynamics approach, the computational burden is drastically alleviated by embedding the DNA molecule in a mixed explicit/implicit salt-bathing solution. In the explicit domain, the water molecules and ions are both overtly present in the system, whereas in the implicit water domain, only the ions are explicitly present and the water is described as a continuous dielectric medium. Water molecules are inserted and deleted into/from the system in the intermediate buffer domain that acts as a water reservoir to the explicit domain, with both water molecules and ions free to enter or leave the explicit domain. Our approach is general and allows for efficient molecular simulations of biomolecules solvated in bathing salt solutions at any ionic strength condition.
","Extrapolation to Nonequilibrium from Coarse-Grained Response Theory
Urna Basu, Laurent Helden, and Matthias Krüger
Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 180604 – Published 4 May 2018

Nonlinear response theory, in contrast to linear cases, involves (dynamical) details, and this makes application to many-body systems challenging. From the microscopic starting point we obtain an exact response theory for a small number of coarse-grained degrees of freedom. With it, an extrapolation scheme uses near-equilibrium measurements to predict far-from-equilibrium properties (here, second order responses). Because it does not involve system details, this approach can be applied to many-body systems. It is illustrated in a four-state model and in the near critical Ising model.

We describe a framework to significantly reduce the computational effort to evaluate large deviation functions of time integrated observables within nonequilibrium steady states. We do this by incorporating an auxiliary dynamics into trajectory based Monte Carlo calculations, through a transformation of the system's propagator using an approximate guiding function. This procedure importance samples the trajectories that most contribute to the large deviation function, mitigating the exponentially complexity of such calculations. We illustrate the method by studying driven diffusions and interacting lattice models in one and two dimensions. Our work offers an avenue to calculate large deviation functions for high dimensional systems driven far from equilibrium.",

Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) assembly occurs on the inner leaflet of the host cell plasma membrane, incorporating the essential viral envelope glycoprotein (Env) within a budding lattice of HIV-1 Gag structural proteins. The mechanism by which Env incorporates into viral particles remains poorly understood. To determine the mechanism of recruitment of Env to assembly sites, we interrogate the subviral angular distribution of Env on cell-associated virus using multicolor, three-dimensional (3D) superresolution microscopy. We demonstrate that, in a manner dependent on cell type and on the long cytoplasmic tail of Env, the distribution of Env is biased toward the necks of cell-associated particles. We postulate that this neck-biased distribution is regulated by vesicular retention and steric complementarity of Env during independent Gag lattice formation.",

Mutual unbiasedness of the eigenstates of phase-space operators—such as position and momentum, or their standard coarse-grained versions—exists only in the limiting case of infinite squeezing. In Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 040403 (2018), it was shown that mutual unbiasedness can be recovered for periodic coarse graining of these two operators. Here we investigate mutual unbiasedness of coarse-grained measurements for more than two phase-space variables. We show that mutual unbiasedness can be recovered between periodic coarse graining of any two nonparallel phase-space operators. We illustrate these results through optics experiments, using the fractional Fourier transform to prepare and measure mutually unbiased phase-space variables. The differences between two and three mutually unbiased measurements is discussed. Our results contribute to bridging the gap between continuous and discrete quantum mechanics, and they could be useful in quantum-information protocols.","(1) Urbančič, I.; Brun, J.; Shrestha, D.; Waithe, D.; Eggeling, C.; Chojnacki, J.

In bionanotechnology, the field of creating functional materials consisting of bio-inspired molecules, the function and shape of a nanostructure only appear through the assembly of many small molecules together. The large number of building blocks required to define a nanostructure combined with the many degrees of freedom in packing small molecules has long precluded molecular simulations, but recent advances in computational hardware as well as software have made classical simulations available to this strongly expanding field. Here, we review the state of the art in simulations of self-assembling bio-inspired supramolecular systems. We will first discuss progress in force fields, simulation protocols and enhanced sampling techniques using recent examples. Secondly, we will focus on efforts to enable the comparison of experimentally accessible observables and computational results. Experimental quantities that can be measured by microscopy, spectroscopy and scattering can be linked to simulation output either directly or indirectly, via quantum mechanical or semi-empirical techniques. Overall, we aim to provide an overview of the various computational approaches to understand not only the molecular architecture of nanostructures, but also the mechanism of their formation.
",,"The role that van der Waals (vdW) attractive forces play in the hydration and association of atomic hydrophobic solutes like argon (Ar) in water is reanalyzed using the local molecular field (LMF) theory of those interactions. In this problem, solute vdW attractive forces can reduce or mask hydrophobic interactions as measured by contact peak heights of the ArAr correlation function compared to reference results for purely repulsive core solutes. Nevertheless, both systems exhibit characteristic hydrophobic inverse temperature behavior in which hydrophobic association become stronger with increasing temperature through a moderate temperature range. The new theoretical approximation obtained here is remarkably simple and faithful to the statistical mechanical LMF assessment of the necessary force balance. Our results extend and significantly revise approximations made in a recent application of the LMF approach to this problem, and, unexpectedly, support a theory of nearly 40 years ago.","Rhinoviruses (RVs) are the pathogens most often responsible for the common cold, and are a frequent cause of exacerbations in asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cystic fibrosis.

"Title: Modulation of the Formation of Aβ- and Sup35NM-Based Amyloids by Complex Interplay of Specific and Nonspecific Ion Effects
Authors: Aditi Sharma, Sven H. Behrens, Yury O. Chernoff, and Andreas S. Bommarius
Abstract: In vitro formation of highly ordered protein aggregates, amyloids, is influenced by the presence of ions. Here, we have studied the effect of anions on amyloid fibril formation by two different amyloidogenic proteins, human amyloid beta-42 (Aβ42), associated with Alzheimer disease and produced recombinantly with an N-terminal methionine (Met-Aβ42), and histidine-tagged NM fragment of Sup35 protein (Sup35NM-His6), a yeast release factor controlling protein-based inheritance, at pH values above and below their isoelectric points. We demonstrate here that pH plays a critical role in determining the effect of ions on the aggregation of Met-Aβ42 and Sup35NM-His6. Further, the electrophoretic mobilities of Met-Aβ42 and Sup35NM-His6 were measured in the presence of different anions at pH above and below the isoelectric points to understand how anions interact with these proteins when they bear a net positive or negative charge. We find that although ion–protein interactions generally follow expectations based on the anion positions within the Hofmeister series, there are qualitative differences in the aggregation behavior of Met-Aβ42 and Sup35NM-His6. These differences arise from a competition between nonspecific charge neutralization and screening effects and specific ion adsorption and can be explained by the different biochemical and biophysical properties of Met-Aβ42 and Sup35NM-His6.

Abstract: The development of effective centroid potentials (ECPs) is explored with both the constrained-centroid and quasi-adiabatic force matching using liquid water as a test system. A trajectory integrated with the ECP is free of statistical noises that would be introduced when the centroid potential is approximated on the fly with a finite number of beads. With the reduced cost of ECP, challenging experimental properties can be studied in the spirit of centroid molecular dynamics. The experimental number density of H2O is 0.38% higher than that of D2O. With the ECP, the H2O number density is predicted to be 0.42% higher, when the dispersion term is not refit. After correction of finite size effects, the diffusion constant of H2O is found to be 21% higher than that of D2O, which is in good agreement with the 29.9% higher diffusivity for H2O observed experimentally. Although the ECP is also able to capture the redshifts of both the OH and OD stretching modes in liquid water, there are a number of properties that a classical simulation with the ECP will not be able to recover. For example, the heat capacities of H2O and D2O are predicted to be almost identical and higher than the experimental values. Such a failure is simply a result of not properly treating quantized vibrational energy levels when the trajectory is propagated with classical mechanics. Several limitations of the ECP based approach without bead population reconstruction are discussed.
","Implicit-solvent dissipative particle dynamics force field based on a four-to-one coarse-grained mapping scheme
Mingwei Wan, Lianghui Gao and Weihai Fang 
PLoS ONE 13(5): e0198049. (2018) doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0198049
A new set of efficient solvent-free dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) force fields was developed for phospholipids and peptides. To enhance transferability, this model maps around four heavy atoms and their connected hydrogen atoms into a coarse-grained elementary bead based on functional group. The effective hybrid potential between any pair of beads is composed of a short-range repulsive soft-core potential that directly adopts the form of an explicit-solvent DPD model and a long-range attractive hydrophobic potential. The parameters of the attractive potentials for lipid molecules were obtained by fitting the explicit-solvent DPD simulation of one bead of any type in a water box, then finely tuning it until the bilayer membrane properties obtained in the explicit-solvent model were matched. These parameters were further extended to amino acids according to bead type. The structural and elastic properties of bilayer membranes, free energy profiles for a lipid flip-flop and amino acid analogues translocating across the membrane, and membrane pore formation induced by antimicrobial peptides obtained from this solvent-free DPD force field considerably agreed with the explicit-solvent DPD results. Importantly, the efficiency of this method is guaranteed to accelerate the assembly of vesicles composed of several thousand lipids by up to 50-fold, rendering the experimental liposome dynamics as well as membrane-peptide interactions feasible at accessible computational expense.

"Title: Orientational Dependence of the van der Waals Interactions for Finite-Sized Particles
Authors: Johannes Fiedler, Clas Persson, Mathias Boström, and Stefan Y. Buhmann
Abstract: Dispersion forces, especially van der Waals forces as interactions between neutral and polarizable particles act at small distances between two objects. Their theoretical origin lies in the electromagnetic interaction between induced dipole moments caused by the vacuum fluctuations of the ground-state electromagnetic field. The resulting theory well describes the experimental situation in the limit of the point dipole assumption. At smaller distances, where the finite size of the particles has to be taken into account, this description fails and has to be corrected by higher orders of the multipole expansion, such as quadrupole moments and so on. With respect to the complexity of the spatial properties of the particles this task requires a considerable effort. In order to describe the van der Waals interaction between such particles, we apply the established method of a spatially spread out polarizability distribution to approximate the higher orders of the multipole expansion. We thereby construct an effective theory for effects from anisotropy and finite size on the van der Waals potential.

Abstract: Stochastic thermostats based on the Langevin equation, in which a system is coupled to an external heat bath, are popular methods for temperature control in molecular dynamics simulations due to their ergodicity and their ease of implementation. Traditionally, these thermostats suffer from sluggish behavior in the limit of high friction, unlike thermostats of the Nosé-Hoover family whose performance degrades more gently in the strong coupling regime. We propose a simple and easy-to-implement modification to the integration scheme of the Langevin algorithm that addresses the fundamental source of the overdamped behavior of high-friction Langevin dynamics: if the action of the thermostat causes the momentum of a particle to change direction, it is flipped back. This fast-forward Langevin equation preserves the momentum distribution and so guarantees the correct equilibrium sampling. It mimics the quadratic behavior of Nosé-Hoover thermostats and displays similarly good performance in the strong coupling limit. We test the efficiency of this scheme by applying it to a 1-dimensional harmonic oscillator, as well as to water and Lennard-Jones polymers. The sampling efficiency of the fast-forward Langevin equation thermostat, measured by the correlation time of relevant system variables, is at least as good as the traditional Langevin thermostat, and in the overdamped regime, the fast-forward thermostat performs much better, improving the efficiency by an order of magnitude at the highest frictions we considered.

At the molecular level, the dynamic instability (random growth and shrinkage) of the microtubule (MT) is driven by the nucleotide state (GTP vs. GDP) in the β subunit of the tubulin dimers at the MT cap. Here, we use large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and normal mode analysis (NMA) to characterize the effect of a single GTP cap layer on tubulin octamers composed by two neighboring protofilaments (PFs). We utilize recently reported high-resolution structures of dynamic MTs to simulate a GDP octamer both with and without a single GTP cap layer. We perform multiple replicas of long-time atomistic MD simulations (3 replicas, ~0.33μs for each replica, ~0.9 μs for each octamer system, and ~1.8 μs total) of both octamers. We observe that a single GTP cap layer induces structural differences in neighboring PFs, finding that one PF possesses a gradual curvature, compared to the second PF which possesses a kinked conformation. This results in either curling or splaying between these PFs. We suggest that this is due to asymmetric strengths of longitudinal contacts between the two PFs. Furthermore, using NMA, we calculate mechanical properties of these octamer systems and find that octamer system with a single GTP cap layer possesses a lower flexural rigidity.

"Title: Interlocking Molecular Gear Chains Built on Surfaces
Authors: Rundong Zhao, Fei Qi, Yan-Ling Zhao, Klaus E. Hermann, Rui-Qin Zhang, and Michel A. Van Hove
Abstract: Periodic chains of molecular gears in which molecules couple with each other and rotate on surfaces have been previously explored by us theoretically using ab initio simulation tools. On the basis of the knowledge and experience gained about the interactions between neighboring molecular gears, we here explore the transmission of rotational motion and energy over larger distances, namely, through a longer chain of gear-like passive “slave” molecules. Such microscopic gears exhibit quite different behaviors compared to rigid cogwheels in the macroscopic world due to their structural flexibility affecting intermolecular interaction. Here, we investigate the capabilities of such gear chains and reveal the mechanisms of the transmission process in terms of both quantum-level density functional theory (DFT) and simple classical mechanics. We find that the transmission of rotation along gear chains depends strongly on the gear–gear distance: short distances can cause tilting of gears and even irregular “creep-then-jump” (or “stick–slip”) motion or expulsion of gears; long gear–gear distances cause weak coupling between gears, slipping and skipping. More importantly, for transmission of rotation at intermediate gear–gear distances, our modeling clearly exhibits the relative roles of several important factors: flexibility of gear arms, axles, and supports, as well as resulting rotational delays, slippages, and thermal and other effects. These studies therefore allow better informed design of future molecular machine components involving motors, gears, axles, etc.

Abstract: Inferential methods can be used to integrate experimental informations and molecular simulations. The maximum entropy principle provides a framework for using equilibrium experimental data, and it has been shown that replica-averaged simulations, restrained using a static potential, are a practical and powerful implementation of such a principle. Here we show that replica-averaged simulations restrained using a time-dependent potential are equivalent to the principle of maximum caliber, the dynamic version of the principle of maximum entropy, and thus may allow us to integrate time-resolved data in molecular dynamics simulations. We provide an analytical proof of the equivalence as well as a computational validation making use of simple models and synthetic data. Some limitations and possible solutions are also discussed.

The physical properties of lipid bilayers, such as curvature and fluidity, can affect the interactions of polypeptides with membranes, influencing biological events. Additionally, given the growing interest in peptide-based therapeutics, understanding the influence of membrane properties on membrane-associated peptides has potential utility. pH low insertion peptides (pHLIPs) are a family of water-soluble peptides that can insert across cell membranes in a pH-dependent manner, enabling the use of pH to follow peptide-lipid interactions. Here we study pHLIP interactions with liposomes varying in size and composition, to determine the influence of several key membrane physical properties. We find that pHLIP binding to bilayer surfaces at neutral pH is governed by the ease of access to the membrane’s hydrophobic core, which can be facilitated by membrane curvature, thickness, and the cholesterol content of the membrane. After surface binding, if the pH is lowered, the kinetics of pHLIP folding to form a helix and subsequent insertion across the membrane depends on the fluidity and energetic dynamics of the membrane. We showed that pHLIP is capable of forming a helix across lipid bilayers of different thicknesses at low pH. However, the kinetics of the slow phase of insertion corresponding to the translocation of C-terminal end of the peptide across lipid bilayer, vary approximately twofold, and correlate with bilayer thickness and fluidity. Although these influences are not large, local curvature variations in membranes of different fluidity could selectively influence surface binding in mixed cell populations.

Takuya Mabuchi and Takashi Tokumasu The Journal of Physical Chemistry B Just Accepted Manuscript DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b02318

A reactive molecular dynamics simulation has been performed for the characterization of the relationship between proton transport and water clustering in polymer electrolyte membranes. We have demonstrated that the anharmonic two-state empirical valence bond (aTS–EVB) model is capable of describing efficiently excess proton transport through the Grotthuss hopping mechanism within the simplicity of the theoretical framework. In order to explore the long-time diffusion behavior in PFSA membranes with statistical certainty, simulations that are longer than 10 ns are needed. The contribution of the Grotthuss mechanism to the proton transport yields a larger fraction compared to the vehicular mechanism when the estimated percolation threshold of λ = 5.6 is surpassed. The cluster analyses elicit a consistent outlook in regard to the relationship between the connectivity and confinement of water clusters and proton transport. The cluster growth behavior findings reveal that below the percolation threshold, the water domains grow along the channel length to form the connected elongated clusters, thus contributing to an increase in connectivity and a decrease in confinement, whereas above the percolation threshold the channel widths of water domains increase, while the elongated structure of clusters is retained, thereby contributing to further confinement decreases.",,

Rodrigo Maghdissian Cordeiro The Journal of Physical Chemistry B Just Accepted Manuscript DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b03406

Phase-separated membrane domains, also known as lipid rafts, are believed to play an important role in cell function. Although most rafts are sterol-enriched membrane regions, evidence suggests that living cells may also contain gel-like rafts. Interactions between gel and fluid domains have a large impact on membrane properties, as is the case with permeability. The membrane permeability may reach a peak at the main phase transition temperature, by far exceeding the values recorded at the fluid phase. It has been proposed that gel-fluid interfaces are leaky, but the effect has not yet been demonstrated at the molecular level. Here, we performed atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of phospholipid bilayers with coexisting gel-like and fluid domains. We found that the thickness mismatch between both phases, the membrane elasticity and the lipid packing acted together to promote the formation of a thickness minimum at the gel-fluid interface. Free energy calculations showed that pore-mediated ionic permeation was strongly facilitated at the constriction region, while water permeation by simple diffusion was only marginally affected. Long-lived, peristaltic undulations were recorded at the bulk fluid phase near the main transition temperature. They gave rise to thickness minima that, although shallower than the interface constrictions, could also enhance permeability. Finally, we demonstrated that an interface constriction was also formed at the boundaries of regular, cholesterol-enriched lipid rafts. Our simulation results will hopefully contribute to a better understanding of biological processes such as transport, signaling, and cellular damage promoted by low temperature and dehydration.",,

To obtain CGFF parameters, we employ a systematic coarse-graining approach based on the relative entropy (RE) method to reproduce not only the structure but also the thermodynamic properties of the reference all-atom molecular model. Our systematic coarse-graining approach adds a constraint to the RE minimization using Lagrange Multiplier in order to reproduce thermodynamic properties such as pressure. The Boltzmann inversion technique is used to obtain the bonded interactions, and the non-bonded and long-range electrostatic interactions are obtained using the constrained relative entropy (CRE) method. The structure and pressure obtained from the coarse-grained (CG) models for different alkyl chain lengths are in agreement with the all-atom molecular dynamics simulations at different thermodynamic states. We also find that the dynamical properties, such as diffusion, of the CG model compare well with the experimental data. The methodology developed here for reproduction of thermodynamic properties and treatment of long-range Coulombic interaction is applicable to other soft-matter.",,

Protein function depends just as much on flexibility as on structure and in numerous cases, a protein's biological activity involves transitions that will impact both its conformation and its mechanical properties. Here, we use a coarse-grain approach to investigate the impact of structural changes on protein flexibility. More particularly, we focus our study on proteins presenting large-scale motions. We show how calculating directional force constants within residue pairs, and investigating their variation upon protein closure, can lead to the detection of a limited set of residues that form a structural lock in the protein's closed conformation. This lock, which is composed of residues whose side-chains are tightly interacting, highlights residues that are important for protein function by stabilizing the closed structure, and which cannot be detected using earlier tools like local rigidity profiles or distance variations maps, or alternative bioinformatics approaches, such as coevolution scores.

PhoB is a response regulator of PhoR/PhoB two-component system from Escherichia coli that is involved in the environmental phosphate regulation. It has been reported that the N-terminal receiver domain (PhoBN) forms a dimer using the α1−α5 face in the apo state and a dimer using the α4−β5−α5 face in the active state investigated by X-ray crystallography. However, it is not clear whether the conformational switch of the dimer is dependent on phosphorylation. Here, we report the NMR studies of PhoBN in solution in its apo form. We observed that the secondary structural fragments of apo PhoBN characterized by NMR are almost the same as those determined by crystallography, but the NMR spectrum of PhoBN shows inhomogeneous amide signals. Concentration dilution experiments and backbone relaxation parameters showed that PhoBN exists in equilibrium between monomer and dimer states. Using paramagnetic relaxation enhancement experiments, we demonstrated that the dimer of apo PhoBN forms several transient dimer interfaces in solution. This finding suggested that, in addition to the monomer-to-dimer exchange, the inactive conformation of PhoBN has different domain arrangements, which are independent of phosphorylation. It provides an experimental data for the conformational selection mechanism of the phosphorylation of PhoBN.",,

Density functional theory simulations, including a correction for dispersive interactions, were performed to investigate the adsorption of water on the main cleavage plane of the fluorite, namely, the (111) surface. In the case of a single molecule of water, we observe that the molecular form is preferred over the dissociated one, and absorbs on the surface with an energy of −55 kJ mol–1, including a significant contribution from the dispersion forces. Also, we show that the substitution of a fluorine atom by a hydroxyl group on the surface of fluorite is not energetically favorable. Then, the hydration of the surface in function of the coverage by water molecules was studied in a systematic way. It was shown that the geometries involving the formation of a cluster of water molecules on the surface, with half of the molecules adsorbed, are the most favorable. Finally, ab initio molecular dynamics conducted at 300 K confirms the trends observed at 0 K, albeit the adsorption energies are reduced by about 10 kJ mol–1. Also, we observe that once put in the interaction with a large number of water molecules, half of the calcium atoms at the surface are in close interaction with a water molecule, whereas the rest of the molecules are further away but present a relatively well-defined structure showing similarities with the one of water clusters.",,

We employ site-specific, linear and nonlinear infrared spectroscopic techniques as well as fluorescence spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the binding interactions of urea and three of its derivatives, methylurea, 1,3-dimethylurea, and tetramethylurea, with protein aromatic and polar side chains. We find that (1) urea methylation leads to preferential interactions between the cosolvent molecules and aromatic side chains with an affinity that increases with the number of methyl groups; (2) interactions with tetramethylurea cause significant dehydration of aromatic side chains and the effect is most pronounced for tryptophan; and (3) while neither urea nor tetramethylurea shows preferential accumulation around a polar side chain, the number of hydrogen-bond donors around this side chain is significantly decreased in the presence of tetramethylurea. Taken together, our findings suggest that these urea derivatives, especially tetramethylurea, can effectively disrupt hydrophobic interactions in proteins. Additionally, tetramethylurea can promote intramolecular hydrogen-bond formation and hence induce α-helix folding in peptides, as observed.",,
"Adaptive enhanced sampling by force-biasing using neural networks

The Journal of Chemical Physics 2018 148:13  Ashley Z. Guo, Emre Sevgen, Hythem Sidky, Jonathan K. Whitmer, Jeffrey A. Hubbell, and Juan J. de Pablo

A machine learning assisted method is presented for molecular simulation of systems with rugged free energy landscapes. The method is general and can be combined with other advanced sampling techniques. In the particular implementation proposed here, it is illustrated in the context of an adaptive biasing force approach where, rather than relying on discrete force estimates, one can resort to a self-regularizing artificial neural network to generate continuous, estimated generalized forces. By doing so, the proposed approach addresses several shortcomings common to adaptive biasing force and other algorithms. Specifically, the neural network enables (1) smooth estimates of generalized forces in sparsely sampled regions, (2) force estimates in previously unexplored regions, and (3) continuous force estimates with which to bias the simulation, as opposed to biases generated at specific points of a discrete grid. The usefulness of the method is illustrated with three different examples, chosen to highlight the wide range of applicability of the underlying concepts. In all three cases, the new method is found to enhance considerably the underlying traditional adaptive biasing force approach. The method is also found to provide improvements over previous implementations of neural network assisted algorithms.

In this study we have used the coarse-grained model developed for the intrinsically disordered saliva protein (IDP) Histatin 5, on an experimental selection of monomeric IDPs, and we show that the model is generally applicable when electrostatic interactions dominate the intra-molecular interactions. Experimental and theoretically calculated small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data are presented in the form of Kratky plots, and discussions are made with respect to polymer theory and the self-avoiding walk model. Furthermore, the impact of electrostatic interactions is shown and related to estimations of the conformational ensembles obtained from computer simulations and “Flexible-meccano”. Special attention is given to the form factor and how it is affected by the salt concentration, as well as the approximation of using the form factor obtained under physiological conditions to obtain the structure factor.","1.

Abstract In this work, we assess a previously advanced hypothesis that predicts the existence of ion channels in the capsid of small and non-enveloped icosahedral viruses. With this purpose we examine Triatoma Virus (TrV) as a case study. This virus has a stable capsid under highly acidic conditions but disassembles and releases the genome in alkaline environments. Our calculations range from a subtle sub-atomic proton interchange to the dismantling of a large-scale system representing several million of atoms. Our results provide structure-based explanations for the three roles played by the capsid to enable genome release. First, we observe, for the first time, the formation of a hydrophobic gate in the cavity along the five-fold axis of the wild-type virus capsid, which can be disrupted by an ion located in the pore. Second, the channel enables protons to permeate the capsid through a unidirectional Grotthuss-like mechanism, which is the most likely process through which the capsid senses pH. Finally, assuming that the proton leak promotes a charge imbalance in the interior of the capsid, we model an internal pressure that forces shell cracking using coarse-grained simulations. Although qualitatively, this last step could represent the mechanism of capsid opening that allows RNA release. All of our calculations are in agreement with current experimental data obtained using TrV and describe a cascade of events that could explain the destabilization and disassembly of similar icosahedral viruses.

"Lifting the Curse of Dimensionality on Enhanced Sampling of Reaction Networks with Parallel Bias Metadynamics

Christopher D Fu and Jim Pfaendtner Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation Just Accepted Manuscript DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.7b01289

A common challenge to applying metadynamics to the study of complex systems is selecting the proper collective variables to bias. The advent of generic collective variables, specifically social permutation invariant (SPRINT) coordinates, has helped addressed this challenge by reducing the level of a priori knowledge required to just basic chemical fundamentals. However, the efficiency of biasing SPRINT coordinates can be severely handicapped by the high dimensionality of the bias potential. Here we circumvent this deficiency by biasing SPRINT coordinates using the parallel bias metadynamics framework. We demonstrate the efficacy of this method to efficiently explore a complex system, without any prior knowledge about transition pathways, by applying it to study the decomposition of γ-ketohydroperoxide and generating a comprehensive reaction network of relevant pathways. The reduction in both computational cost and chemical intuition makes this method a promising option for studying complex reacting systems.","DROIDS 1.20: A GUI-Based Pipeline for GPU-Accelerated Comparative Protein Dynamics

Traditional informatics in comparative genomics work only with static representations of biomolecules (i.e. sequence and structure), thereby ignoring the molecular dynamics (MD) of proteins that define function in the cell. A comparative approach applied to MD would connect this very short timescale process, defined in femtoseconds, to one of the longest in the universe: molecular evolution measured in millions of years. Here, we leverage advances in graphics-processing-unit-accelerated MD simulation software to develop a comparative method of MD analysis and visualization that can be applied to any two homologous Protein Data Bank structures. Our open-source pipeline, DROIDS (Detecting Relative Outlier Impacts in Dynamic Simulations), works in conjunction with existing molecular modeling software to convert any Linux gaming personal computer into a ‘‘comparative computational microscope’’ for observing the biophysical effects of mutations and other chemical changes in proteins. DROIDS implements structural alignment and Benjamini-Hochberg-corrected Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics to compare nanosecond-scale atom bond fluctuations on the protein backbone, color mapping the significant differences identified in protein MD with single-amino-acid resolution. DROIDS is simple to use, incorporating graphical user interface control for Amber16 MD simulations, cpptraj analysis, and the final statistical and visual representations in R graphics and UCSF Chimera. We demonstrate that DROIDS can be utilized to visually investigate molecular evolution and disease-related functional changes in MD due to genetic mutation and epigenetic modification. DROIDS can also be used to potentially investigate binding interactions of pharmaceuticals, toxins, or other biomolecules in a functional evolutionary context as well.","2. Combining Enhanced Sampling with Experiment Directed Simulation of the GYG peptide

DOI: arXiv:1804.05100v1
Ref: arXiv:1804.05100v1
Abstract Experiment directed simulation is a technique to minimally bias molecular dynamics simulations to match experimentally observed results. The method improves accuracy but does not address the sampling problem of molecular dynamics simulations of large systems. This work combines experiment directed simulation with both the parallel-tempering and parallel-tempering well-tempered ensemble replica-exchange methods to enhance sampling of experiment directed simulations. These methods are demonstrated on the GYG tripeptide in explicit water. The collective variables biased by experiment directed simulation are chemical shifts, where the set-points are determined by NMR experiments. The results show that it is possible to enhance sampling with either parallel-tempering and parallel-tempering well-tempered ensemble in the experiment directed simulation method. This combination of methods provides a novel approach for both accurately and exhaustively simulating biological systems.

During immature capsid assembly, HIV-1 genome packaging is initiated when Gag first associates with unspliced HIV-1 RNA by a poorly understood process. Previously, we defined a pathway of sequential intracellular HIV-1 capsid assembly intermediates; here we sought to identify the intermediate in which HIV-1 Gag first associates with unspliced HIV-1 RNA. In provirus-expressing cells, unspliced HIV-1 RNA was not found in the soluble frac- tion of the cytosol, but instead was largely in complexes!30S.Wedid not detect unspliced HIV-1 RNA associated with Gag in the first assembly intermediate, which consists of soluble Gag. Instead, the earliest assembly intermediate in which we detected Gag associated with unspliced HIV-1 RNA was the second assembly intermediate (~80S intermediate), which is derived from a host RNA granule containing two cellular facilitators of assembly, ABCE1 and the RNA granule protein DDX6. At steady-state, this RNA-granule-derived ~80S complex was the smallest assembly intermediate that contained Gag associated with unspliced viral RNA, regardless of whether lysates contained intact or disrupted ribosomes, or expressedWTor assembly-defective Gag. A similar complex was identified in HIV-1- infected T cells. RNA-granule-derived assembly intermediates were detected in situ as sites of Gag colocalization with ABCE1 and DDX6; moreover these granules were far more numerous and smaller than well-studied RNA granules termed P bodies. Finally, we identified two steps that lead to association of assembling Gag with unspliced HIV-1 RNA. Independent of viral-RNA-binding, Gag associates with a broad class of RNA granules that largely lacks unspliced viral RNA (step 1). If a viral-RNA-binding domain is present, Gag further localizes to a subset of these granules that contains unspliced viral RNA (step 2). Thus, our data raise the possibility that HIV-1 packaging is initiated not by soluble Gag, but by Gag targeted to a subset of host RNA granules containing unspliced HIV-1 RNA.",
"A simple and effective solution to the constrained QM/MM simulations

Hideaki Takahashi, Hiroyuki Kambe, and Akihiro Morita The Journal of Chemical Physics 2018 148:13

It is a promising extension of the quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) approach to incorporate the solvent molecules surrounding the QM solute into the QM region to ensure the adequate description of the electronic polarization of the solute. However, the solvent molecules in the QM region inevitably diffuse into the MM bulk during the QM/MM simulation. In this article, we developed a simple and efficient method, referred to as the “boundary constraint with correction (BCC),” to prevent the diffusion of the solvent water molecules by means of a constraint potential. The point of the BCC method is to compensate the error in a statistical property due to the bias potential by adding a correction term obtained through a set of QM/MM simulations. The BCC method is designed so that the effect of the bias potential completely vanishes when the QM solvent is identical with the MM solvent. Furthermore, the desirable conditions, that is, the continuities of energy and force and the conservations of energy and momentum, are fulfilled in principle. We applied the QM/MM-BCC method to a hydronium ion(H3O+H3O+) in aqueous solution to construct the radial distribution function (RDF) of the solvent around the solute. It was demonstrated that the correction term fairly compensated the error and led the RDF in good agreement with the result given by an ab initio molecular dynamics simulation.
","Fine tuning classical and quantum molecular dynamics using a generalizedLangevin equation

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4990536

Generalized Langevin Equation (GLE) thermostats have been used very effectively as a tool to manipulate and optimize the sampling of thermodynamic ensembles and the associated static properties. Here we show that a similar, exquisite level of control can be achieved for the dynamical properties computed from thermostatted trajectories. We develop quantitative measures of the disturbance induced by the GLE to the Hamiltonian dynamics of a harmonic oscillator, and show that these analytical results accurately predict the behavior of strongly anharmonic systems. We also show that it is possible to correct, to a significant extent, the effects of the GLE term onto the corresponding microcanonical dynamics, which puts on more solid grounds the use of non-equilibrium Langevin dynamics to approximate quantum nuclear effects and could help improve the prediction of dynamical quantities from techniques that use a Langevin term to stabilize dynamics. Finally we address the use of thermostats in the context of approximate path-integral-based models of quantum nuclear dynamics. We demonstrate that a custom-tailored GLE can alleviate some of the artifacts associated with these techniques, improving the quality of results for the modeling of vibrational dynamics of molecules, liquids, and solids.

DOI: arXiv:1804.04997v1
Ref: arXiv:1804.04997v1
Abstract Coarse grain (CG) molecular dynamics (MD) can simulate systems inaccessible to fine grain (FG) MD simulations. A CG simulation decreases the degrees of freedom by mapping atoms from an FG representation into agglomerate CG particles. The FG to CG mapping is not unique. Research into systematic selection of these mappings is challenging due to their combinatorial growth with respect to the number of atoms in a molecule. Here we present a method of reducing the total count of mappings by imposing molecular topology and symmetry constraints. The count reduction is illustrated by considering all mappings for nearly 49,889 molecules. The resulting number of mapping operators is still large, so we introduce hierarchical graphs which encode multiple CG mapping operators. The encoding method is demonstrated for methanol and a 14-mer peptide. This encoding provides a foundation to perform automated mapping selection.
","Lipid self-assembly and lectin-induced reorganization of the plasma membrane. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B. 373: 20170117.

The plasmamembrane represents an outstanding example of self-organization in biology. It plays a vital role in protecting the integrity of the cell interior and regulates meticulously the import and export of diverse substances. Its major building blocks are proteins and lipids, which self-assemble to a fluid lipid bilayer driven mainly by hydrophobic forces. Even if the plasma membrane appears—globally speaking—homogeneous at physiological temperatures, the existence of specialized nano- to micrometre-sized domains of raft-type character within cellular and synthetic membrane systems has been reported. It is hypothesized that these domains are the origin of a plethora of cellular processes, such as signalling or vesicular trafficking. This review intends to highlight the driving forces of lipid self-assembly into a bilayer membrane and the formation of small, transient domains within the plasma membrane. The mechanisms of self-assembly depend on several factors, such as the lipid composition of the membrane and the geometry of lipids. Moreover, the dynamics and organization of glycosphingolipids into nanometre-sized clusters will be discussed, also in the context of multivalent lectins, which cluster several glycosphingolipid receptor molecules and thus create an asymmetric stress between the two membrane leaflets, leading to tubular plasma membrane invaginations.",

Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that lacks effective treatment options. Anti-amyloid beta (A) antibodies are the leading drug candidates to treat AD, but the results of clinical trials have been disappointing. Introducing rational mutations into anti-A antibodies to increase their effectiveness is a way forward, but the path to take is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate the use of computational fragment-based docking and MMPBSA binding free energy calculations in the analysis of anti-A antibodies for rational drug design efforts. Our fragment-based docking method successfully predicts the emergence of the common EFRH epitope. MD simulations coupled with MMPBSA binding free energy calculations are used to analyze scenarios described in prior studies, and we computationally introduce rational mutations into PFA1 to predict mutations that can improve its binding affinity towards the pE3-A3−8 form of A. Two out of our four proposed mutations are predicted to stabilize binding. Our study demonstrates that a computational approach may lead to an improved drug candidate for AD in the future.","Water-like anomalies as a function of tetrahedrality, John Russo, Kenji Akahane and Hajime Tanaka Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, April 10, 2018, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1722339115, Tetrahedral interactions describe the behavior of the most abundant and technologically important materials on Earth, such as water, silicon, carbon, germanium, and countless others. Despite their differences, these materials share unique common physical behaviors, such as liquid anomalies, open crystalline structures, and extremely poor glass-forming ability at ambient pressure. To reveal the physical origin of these anomalies and their link to the shape of the phase diagram, we systematically study the properties of the Stillinger–Weber potential as a function of the strength of the tetrahedral interaction λλ. We uncover a unique transition to a reentrant spinodal line at low values of λλ, accompanied with a change in the dynamical behavior, from non-Arrhenius to Arrhenius. We then show that a two-state model can provide a comprehensive understanding on how the thermodynamic and dynamic anomalies of this important class of materials depend on the strength of the tetrahedral interaction. Our work establishes a deep link between the shape of the phase diagram and the thermodynamic and dynamic properties through local structural ordering in liquids and hints at why water is so special among all substances.","4.

Enveloping distribution sampling (EDS) is an efficient approach to calculate multiple free-energy differences from a single molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. However, the construction of an appropriate reference state Hamiltonian that samples all states efficiently is not straightforward. We propose a novel approach for the construction of the EDS reference state Hamiltonian, related to a previously described procedure to smoothen energy landscapes. In contrast to previously suggested EDS approaches, our reference-state Hamiltonian preserves local energy minima of the combined end-states. Moreover, we propose an intuitive, robust and efficient parameter optimization scheme to tune EDS Hamiltonian parameters. We demonstrate the proposed method with established and novel test systems and conclude that our approach allows for the automated calculation of multiple free-energy differences from a single simulation. Accelerated EDS promises to be a robust and user-friendly method to compute free-energy differences based on solid statistical mechanics.

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2018.03.020, Abstract: Cellular membranes are laterally organized into domains of distinct structures and compositions by the differential interaction affinities between various membrane lipids and proteins. A prominent example of such structures are lipid rafts, which are ordered, tightly packed domains that have been widely implicated in cellular processes. The functionality of raft domains is driven by their selective recruitment of specific membrane proteins to regulate their interactions and functions; however, there have been few general insights into the factors that determine the partitioning of membrane proteins between coexisting liquid domains. In this work, we used extensive coarse-grained and atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, potential of mean force calculations, and conceptual models to describe the partitioning dynamics and energetics of a model transmembrane domain from the linker of activation of T cells. We find that partitioning between domains is determined by an interplay between protein-lipid interactions and differential lipid packing between raft and nonraft domains. Specifically, we show that partitioning into ordered domains is promoted by preferential interactions between peptides and ordered lipids, mediated in large part by modification of the peptides by saturated fatty acids (i.e., palmitoylation). Ordered phase affinity is also promoted by elastic effects, specifically hydrophobic matching between the membrane and the peptide. Conversely, ordered domain partitioning is disfavored by the tight molecular packing of the lipids therein. The balance of these dominant drivers determines partitioning. In the case of the wild-type linker of activation of T cells transmembrane domain, these factors combine to yield enrichment of the peptide at Lo/Ld interfaces. These results define some of the general principles governing protein partitioning between coexisting membrane domains and potentially explain previous disparities among experiments and simulations across model systems.",

We present a new simulation technique to study systems of polymers functionalized by reactive sites that bind/unbind forming reversible linkages. Functionalized polymers feature self-assembly and responsive properties that are unmatched by the systems lacking selective interactions. The scales at which the functional properties of these materials emerge are difficult to model, especially in the reversible regime where such properties result from many binding/unbinding events. This difficulty is related to large entropic barriers associated with the formation of intra-molecular loops. In this work, we present a simulation scheme that sidesteps configurational costs by dedicated Monte Carlo moves capable of binding/unbinding reactive sites in a single step. Cross-linking reactions are implemented by trial moves that reconstruct chain sections attempting, at the same time, a dimerization reaction between pairs of reactive sites. The model is parametrized by the reaction equilibrium constant of the reactive species free in solution. This quantity can be obtained by means of experiments or atomistic/quantum simulations. We use the proposed methodology to study the self-assembly of single-chain polymeric nanoparticles, starting from flexible precursors carrying regularly or randomly distributed reactive sites. We focus on understanding differences in the morphology of chain nanoparticles when linkages are reversible as compared to the well-studied case of irreversible reactions. Intriguingly, we find that the size of regularly functionalized chains, in good solvent conditions, is non-monotonous as a function of the degree of functionalization. We clarify how this result follows from excluded volume interactions and is peculiar of reversible linkages and regular functionalizations.","Machine learning of biomolecular reaction coordinates, Simon Brandt, Florian Sittel, Matthias Ernst and Gerhard Stock, Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters, April 9, 2018 DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpclett.8b00759, We present a systematic approach to reduce the dimensionality of a complex molecular system. Starting with a data set of molecular coordinates (obtained from experiment or simulation) and an associated set of metastable conformational states (obtained from clustering the data), a supervised machine learning model is trained to assign unknown molecular structures to the set of metastable states. In this way, the model learns to determine the features of the molecular coordinates that are most important to discriminate the states. Using a new algorithm that exploits this feature importance via an iterative exclusion principle, we identify the essential internal coordinates (such as specific interatomic distances or dihedral angles) of the system, which are shown to represent versatile reaction coordinates that account for the dynamics of the slow degrees of freedom and explain the mechanism of the underlying processes. Moreover, these coordinates give rise to a free energy landscape that may reveal previously hidden intermediate states of the system.","5.

We determine the distribution of dihedral angles in palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine from molecular dynamics simulations of hydrated fluid bilayer membranes. We compare results from the widely used lipid force field of Berger et al. with those from the most recent C36 release of the CHARMM force field for lipids. Only the CHARMM force field produces the chain inequivalence with sn-1 as leading chain that is characteristic of glycerolipid packing in fluid bilayers. The exposure and high partial charge of the backbone carbonyls in Berger lipids leads to artifactual binding of Na+ ions reported in the literature. Both force fields predict coupled, near-symmetrical distributions of headgroup dihedral angles, which is compatible with models of interconverting mirror-image conformations used originally to interpret NMR order parameters. The Berger force field produces rotamer populations that correspond to the headgroup conformation found in a phosphatidylcholine lipid bilayer crystal, whereas CHARMM36 rotamer populations are closer to the more relaxed crystal conformations of phosphatidylethanolamine and glycerophosphocholine. CHARMM36 alone predicts the correct relative signs of the time-average headgroup order parameters, and reasonably reproduces the full range of NMR data from the phosphate diester to the choline methyls. There is strong motivation to seek further experimental criteria for verifying predicted conformational distributions in the choline headgroup, including the 31P chemical shift anisotropy and 14N and CD3 NMR quadrupole splittings.",

We study generic properties of poly(ionic liquid)s (PILs) via coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations in bulk solution and under confinement. The influence of different side chain lengths on the spatial properties of the PIL systems and on the ionic transport mechanism is investigated in detail. Our results reveal the formation of apolar and polar nanodomains with increasing side chain length in good agreement with previous results for molecular ionic liquids. The ion transport numbers are unaffected by the occurrence of these domains, and the corresponding values highlight the potential role of PILs as single-ion conductors in electrochemical devices. In contrast to bulk behavior, a pronounced formation of ion conductivity channels in confined systems is initiated in close vicinity to the boundaries. We observe higher ion conductivities in these channels for increasing PIL side chain lengths in comparison with bulk values and provide an explanation for this effect. The appearance of these domains points to an improved application of PILs in modern polymer electrolyte batteries.","Stochastic ratcheting on a funneled energy landscape is necessary for highly efficient contractility of actomyosin force dipoles, James E Komianos and Garegin A Papoian, Physical Review X, April 4, 2018, DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevX.8.021006, Current understanding of how contractility emerges in disordered actomyosin networks of nonmuscle cells is still largely based on the intuition derived from earlier works on muscle contractility. In addition, in disordered networks, passive cross-linkers have been hypothesized to percolate force chains in the network, hence, establishing large-scale connectivity between local contractile clusters. This view, however, largely overlooks the free energy of cross-linker binding at the microscale, which, even in the absence of active fluctuations, provides a thermodynamic drive towards highly overlapping filamentous states. In this work, we use stochastic simulations and mean-field theory to shed light on the dynamics of a single actomyosin force dipole—a pair of antiparallel actin filaments interacting with active myosin II motors and passive cross-linkers. We first show that while passive cross-linking without motor activity can produce significant contraction between a pair of actin filaments, driven by thermodynamic favorability of cross-linker binding, a sharp onset of kinetic arrest exists at large cross-link binding energies, greatly diminishing the effectiveness of this contractility mechanism. Then, when considering an active force dipole containing nonmuscle myosin II, we find that cross-linkers can also serve as a structural ratchet when the motor dissociates stochastically from the actin filaments, resulting in significant force amplification when both molecules are present. Our results provide predictions of how actomyosin force dipoles behave at the molecular level with respect to filament boundary conditions, passive cross-linking, and motor activity, which can explicitly be tested using an optical trapping experiment","BFEE: A User-Friendly Graphical Interface Facilitating Absolute Binding Free-Energy Calculations

Quantifying protein–ligand binding has attracted the attention of both theorists and experimentalists for decades. Many methods for estimating binding free energies in silico have been reported in recent years. Proper use of the proposed strategies requires, however, adequate knowledge of the protein–ligand complex, the mathematical background for deriving the underlying theory, and time for setting up the simulations, bookkeeping, and postprocessing. Here, to minimize human intervention, we propose a toolkit aimed at facilitating the accurate estimation of standard binding free energies using a geometrical route, coined the binding free-energy estimator (BFEE), and introduced it as a plug-in of the popular visualization program VMD. Benefitting from recent developments in new collective variables, BFEE can be used to generate the simulation input files, based solely on the structure of the complex. Once the simulations are completed, BFEE can also be utilized to perform the post-treatment of the free-energy calculations, allowing the absolute binding free energy to be estimated directly from the one-dimensional potentials of mean force in simulation outputs. The minimal amount of human intervention required during the whole process combined with the ergonomic graphical interface makes BFEE a very effective and practical tool for the end-user.","Mechanical differences between ATP and ADP actin states: A molecular dynamics study

This paper aims to give a comprehensive atomistic modeling of the nanomechanical behavior of actin monomer. Actin is a ubiquitous and essential component of cytoskeleton which forms many different cellular structures. Despite for several years great effort has been devoted to the investigation of mechanical properties of the actin filament, studies on the nanomechanical behavior of actin monomer are still lacking. These scales are, however, important for a complete understanding of the role of actin as an important component in the cytoskeleton structure. Based on the accuracy of atomistic modeling methods such as molecular dynamics simulations, steered molecular dynamics method is performed to assess tension of monomeric G-actin molecule under different types of mechanical loading including axial and lateral. As a result, stress-strain curves are obtained in aqueous solution, with either ATP or ADP bound in the nucleotide binding pocket. The obtained results yield evaluation of the tensile stiffness of a single actin monomer in lateral and normal direction. In order to compare the behavior of ATP and ADP G-actins, the number of hydrogen bonds and nonbonded interactions between the nucleotide and the protein are analyzed. Moreover, The effect of virtual spring of steered molecular dynamics on the mechanical behavior of actin monomer is investigated. The results reveal increasing the virtual spring constant leads to convergence of the stiffness. Moreover, in this paper, a generalized model is proposed to extend the obtained results for the monomeric G-actin scale to the actin filament. Our modeling estimated a persistence length of actin filament 15.41 µm, close to experimental measurements. Moreover, In this paper, the breaking force actin-actin bond is evaluated using steered molecular dynamics simulation. By applying a tensile force, actin-actin bond ruptured at 4197.5 pN.

"Limited Resources Induce Bistability in Microtubule Length Regulation

Physical Review Letters Volume 120, 2018, pp 148101 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.148101

The availability of protein is an important factor for the determination of the size of the mitotic spindle. Involved in spindle-size regulation is kinesin-8, a molecular motor and microtubule (MT) depolymerase, which is known to tightly control MT length. Here, we propose and analyze a theoretical model in which kinesin-induced MT depolymerization competes with spontaneous polymerization while supplies of both tubulin and kinesin are limited. In contrast to previous studies where resources were unconstrained, we find that, for a wide range of concentrations, MT length regulation is bistable. We test our predictions by conducting in vitro experiments and find that the bistable behavior manifests in a bimodal MT length distribution.","Lipid-protein interaction induced domains: Kinetics and conformational changes in multicomponent vesicles

The spatio-temporal organization of proteins and the associated morphological changes in membranes are of importance in cell signaling. Several mechanisms that promote the aggregation of proteins at low cell surface concentrations have been investigated in the past. We show, using Monte Carlo simulations, that the affinity of proteins for specific lipids can hasten their aggregation kinetics. The lipid membrane is modeled as a dynamically triangulated surface with the proteins defined as in-plane fields at the vertices. We show that, even at low protein concentrations, strong lipid-protein interactions can result in large protein clusters indicating a route to lipid mediated signal amplification. At high protein concentrations, the domains form buds similar to that seen in lipid-lipid interaction induced phase separation. Protein interaction induced domain budding is suppressed when proteins act as anisotropic inclusions and exhibit nematic orientational order. The kinetics of protein clustering and resulting conformational changes are shown to be significantly different for the isotropic and anisotropic curvature inducing proteins.

Saturation transfer difference (STD) is an NMR technique conventionally applied in drug discovery to identify ligand moieties relevant for binding to protein cavities. This is important to direct medicinal chemistry efforts in small-molecule optimization processes. However, STD does not provide any structural details about the ligand–target complex under investigation. Herein, we report the application of a new integrated approach, which combines enhanced sampling methods with STD experiments, for the characterization of ligand–target complexes that are instrumental for drug design purposes. As an example, we have studied the interaction between StOASS-A, a potential antibacterial target, and an inhibitor previously reported. This approach allowed us to consider the ligand–target complex from a dynamic point of view, revealing the presence of an accessory subpocket which can be exploited to design novel StOASS-A inhibitors. As a proof of concept, a small library of derivatives was designed and evaluated in vitro, displaying the expected activity.","Modeling the dynamics and kinetics of HIV-1 Gag during viral assembly

We report a computational model for the assembly of HIV-1 Gag into immature viral particles at the plasma membrane. To reproduce experimental structural and kinetic properties of assembly, a process occurring on the order of minutes, a coarse-grained representation consisting of a single particle per Gag molecule is developed. The model uses information relating the functional interfaces implicated in Gag assembly, results from cryo electron-tomography, and biophysical measurements from fluorescence microscopy, such as the dynamics of Gag assembly at single virions. These experimental constraints eliminated many classes of potential interactions, and narrowed the model to a single interaction scheme with two non-equivalent interfaces acting to form Gags into a hexamer, and a third interface acting to link hexamers together. This model was able to form into a hexameric structure with correct lattice spacing and reproduced biologically relevant growth rates. We explored the effect of genomic RNA seeding punctum growth, finding that RNA may be a factor in locally concentrating Gags to initiate assembly. The simulation results infer that completion of assembly cannot be governed simply by Gag binding kinetics. However the addition of membrane curvature suggests that budding of the virion from the plasma membrane could factor into slowing incorporation of Gag at an assembly site resulting in virions of the same size and number of Gag molecules independent of Gag concentration or the time taken to complete assembly. To corroborate the results of our simulation model, we developed an analytic model for Gag assembly finding good agreement with the simulation results.

Abstract        
We propose to investigate the size-effects on the calculation of the surface tension with coarse-grained (CG) models. We take the route of studying different liquid-vapor and liquid-liquid interfaces with the MARTINI forcefield and orignal CG models used in the dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) and multibody particle dynamics (MDPD) simulations. We also test a realistic CG potential developed for the DPD method to investigate the liquid-vapor interface of \emph{n}-pentane. With the MARTINI model, we observe a weak oscillatory effect of the interfacial tension with the surface area for the liquid-vapor interfaces of \emph{n}-octane and water. This weak dependence of the surface tension with the box dimension is also observed in the liquid-liquid interface of \emph{n}-octane-water (MARTINI, DPD) and in the liquid-vapor interface of water with the MDPD model..

arXiv:1803.06873v1 [q-bio.BM] (2018)
The recent rise of cryo-EM and X-ray high-throughput techniques is providing a wealth of new structures trapped in different conformations. Understanding how proteins transition between different conformers, and how they relate to each other in terms of function is not straightforward, and highly depends on the choice of the right set of degrees of freedom. Here we present eBDIMS server, an online tool and software for automatic classification of structural ensembles and reconstruction of transition pathways using coarse-grained (CG) simulations. The server generates CG-pathways between two protein conformations along with a representation in a simplified 2D-motion landscape based on the Principal Components (PCs) from experimental structures. For a conformationally rich ensemble, the PCs provide powerful reaction coordinates for automatic structure classification, detection of on-pathway intermediates and validation of in silico pathways. When the number of available structures is low or sampling is limited, Normal Modes (NMs) provide alternative motion axes for trajectory analysis. The path-generation eBDIMS method is available at a user-friendly website: https://login.biophysics.kth.se/eBDIMS/ or as standalone software. The server incorporates a powerful interactive graphical interface for simultaneous visualization of transition pathways in 2Dmotion space and 3D-molecular graphics, which greatly facilitates the exploration of the relationships between different conformations.

Gromacs is one of the most popular molecular simulation suites currently available. In this contribution we present streaMD, the first interface between Gromacs trajectory files and the statistical language R. The amount of data created due to ever increasing computational power renders fast and efficient analysis of trajectories into a challenge. Especially as standard approaches such as root‐mean square fluctuations and the like provide only limited physical insight. In our streaMD package integration of the Gromacs I/O libraries with advanced, graph‐based analysis methods as the java library Stream leads to both: improved speed and analysis depth. We benchmark our results and highlight the applicability of the package by an interesting problem in RNA design, namely the interaction of tetracycline with an aptamer
","Title: Hydrogen bond networks near supported lipid bilayers from vibrational sum frequency generation experiments and atomistic simulations, Authors: Merve Dogangun, Paul E Ohna, Dongyue Liang, Alicia McGeachy, Ariana Gray Be, Naomi Dlachans, Tianzhe Li, Qiang Cui, Franz Geiger, Journal: Journal of Physical Chemistry B, Publication (web): April 24, 2018, DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b02138, Abstract: We report vibrational sum frequency generation (SFG) spectra in which the C–H stretches of lipid alkyl tails in fully hydrogenated single- and dual-component supported lipid bilayers are detected along with the O–H stretching continuum above the bilayer. As the salt concentration is increased from ~10 µM to 0.1 M, the SFG intensities in the O–H stretching region decrease by a factor of 2, consistent with significant absorptive-dispersive mixing between χ(2) and χ(3) contributions to the SFG signal generation process from charged interfaces. A method for estimating the surface potential from the second-order spectral lineshapes (in the OH stretching region) is presented and discussed in the context of choosing truly zero-potential reference states. Aided by atomistic simulations, we find that the strength and orientation distribution of the hydrogen bonds over the purely zwitterionic bilayers are largely invariant between sub-micromolar and hundreds of millimolar concentrations. However, specific interactions between water molecules and lipid headgroups are observed upon replacing phosphocholine (PC) lipids with negatively charged phosphoglycerol (PG) lipids, which coincides with SFG signal intensity reductions in the 3100 cm-1 to 3200 cm-1 frequency region. The atomistic simulations show that this outcome is consistent with a small, albeit statistically significant, decrease in the number of water molecules adjacent to both the lipid phosphate and choline moieties per unit area, supporting the SFG observations. Ultimately, the ability to probe hydrogen-bond networks over lipid bilayers holds the promise of opening paths for understanding, controlling, and predicting specific and non-specific interactions between membranes and ions, small molecules, peptides, polycations, proteins, and coated and uncoated nanomaterials.",

Abstract
In this work, electrostatic forces between charged nanogels are explored through coarse-grained simulations for the first time. These simulations allow us to explicitly consider the complex topology of these nanoparticles and provide reliable force values to examine highly charged nanogels of a few tens of nanometers. The results obtained here clearly reveal that the electrostatic interactions between these nanoparticles are not governed by the net charge of the nanogel, which includes not only the charge of the polymer network but also the charge of ions inside. Thus two theoretical procedures for predicting effective charges are also proposed and investigated. Both provide predictions of the same order and capture the behavior found for the effective charge obtained from simulations..
","Self-assembly of amphiphilic truncated cones to form hollow nanovesicles
Yali Wang and Xuehao He
RSC Adv., 8, 13526-13536 (2018) doi: 10.1039/C8RA01100A
To mimic the unique properties of capsid (protein shell of a virus), we performed Brownian dynamics simulations of the self-assembly of amphiphilic truncated cone particles with anisotropic interactions. The particle shape of a truncated cone in our simulations depended on the cone angle θ, truncated height hc and particle type (AxBy and BxAyBz). The hydrophobic A moieties and hydrophilic B moieties are responsible for attractive and repulsive interactions, respectively. By varying the particle shape, truncated cones can assemble into hollow and vesicle-like clusters with a specific cluster size N. To assemble into hollow vesicles, the truncated height hc must be below a critical value. When hc exceeds this critical value, malformation will occur. The dynamics shows that the vesicle formation occurs in three stages: initially the growth is slow, then rapid, and finally it slows down. The truncated height hc has a stronger impact on the growth kinetics than the cone angle θ or the particle type. We explored how the cluster packing depended on the cooling rate and particle number as well as discussing the relationship between the cluster geometry and the interparticle interactions. Further, we also discuss possible methods to experimentally prepare the truncated cones. The results of our work deepen our understanding of the self-assembly behavior of truncated cones and our results will aid the effective design of particle building blocks for novel nanostructures.

Abstract: Charge-transfer (CT) is an important binding force in the formation of intermolecular complexes, and there have been a variety of theoretical models proposed to quantify this effect. These approaches, which typically rely on a definition of a “CT-free” state based on a partition of the system, sometimes yield significantly different results for a given intermolecular complex. Two widely used definitions of the “CT-free” state, the absolutely localized molecular orbitals (ALMO) method (where only on-fragment orbital mixings are permitted) and the constrained density functional theory (CDFT) approach (where fragment electron populations are fixed), are carefully examined in this work. Natural bond orbital (NBO) and the regularized symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) are also briefly considered. Results for the ALMO and CDFT definitions of CT are compared on a broad range of model systems, including hydrogen-bonding systems, borane complexes, metal–carbonyl complexes, and complexes formed by water and metal cations. For most of these systems, CDFT yields a much smaller equilibrium CT energy compared to that given by the ALMO-based definition. This is mainly because the CDFT population constraint does not fully inhibit CT, which means that the CDFT “CT-free” state is in fact CT-contaminated. Examples of this contamination include (i) matching forward and backward donation (e.g., formic acid dimer) and (ii) unidirectional CT without changing fragment populations. The magnitude of the latter effect is quantified in systems such as the water dimer by employing a 3-space density constraint in addition to the orbital constraint. Furthermore, by means of the adiabatic EDA, it is shown that several observable effects of CT, such as the “pyramidalization” of the planar BH3 molecule upon the complexation with Lewis bases, already appear on the “CT-free” CDFT surface. These results reveal the essential distinctions between the ALMO and CDFT definitions of CT and suggest that the former is more consistent with accepted understanding of the role of CT in intermolecular binding.
","Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of fibrin polymerization: effects of thrombin concentration on fibrin clot structure

Studies suggest that patients with deep vein thrombosis and diabetes often have hypercoagulable blood plasma, leading to a higher risk of thromboembolism formation through the rupture of blood clots, which may lead to stroke and death. Despite many advances in the field of blood clot formation and thrombosis, the influence of mechanical properties of fibrin in the formation of thromboembolisms in platelet-poor plasma is poorly understood. In this paper, we combine the concepts of reactive molecular dynamics and coarse-grained molecular modeling to predict the complex network formation of fibrin clots and the branching of fibrin monomers. The 340-kDa fibrinogen molecule was converted into a coarse-grained molecule with nine beads, and using our customized reactive potentials, we simulated the formation and polymerization process of a fibrin clot. The results show that higher concentrations of thrombin result in higher branch-point formation in the fibrin clot structure. Our results also highlight many interesting properties, such as the formation of thicker or thinner fibers depending on the thrombin concentration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful molecular polymerization study of fibrin clots to focus on thrombin concentration.

Abstract
We present an investigation of vibrational features in water clusters performed by means of our recently established divide-and-conquer semiclassical approach [M. Ceotto, G. Di Liberto, and R. Conte, Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 010401 (2017)]. This technique allows us to simulate quantum vibrational spectra of high-dimensional systems starting from full-dimensional classical trajectories and projection of the semiclassical propagator onto a set of lower dimensional subspaces. The potential energy surface employed is a many-body representation up to three-body terms, in which monomers and two-body interactions are described by the high level Wang-Huang-Braams-Bowman (WHBB) water potential, while, for three-body interactions, calculations adopt a fast permutationally invariant ab initio surface at the same level of theory of the WHBB 3-body potential. Applications range from the water dimer up to the water decamer, a system made of 84 vibrational degrees of freedom. Results are generally in agreement with previous variational estimates in the literature. This is particularly true for the bending and the high-frequency stretching motions, while estimates of modes strongly influenced by hydrogen bonding are red shifted, in a few instances even substantially, as a consequence of the dynamical and global picture provided by the semiclassical approach..

Understanding the (de)mixing behavior of multicomponent lipid bilayers is an important step towards unraveling the nature of spatial composition heterogeneities in cellular membranes and their role in biological function. We use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to study the composition phase diagram of a quaternary mixture of phospholipids and cholesterol. This mixture is known to exhibit both uniform and coexisting phases. We compare and combine different statistical measures of membrane structure to identify the onset of phase coexistence in composition space. An important element in our approach is the dependence of composition heterogeneities on the size of the system. While homogeneous phases can be structured and display long correlation lengths, the hallmark behavior of phase coexistence is the scaling of the apparent correlation length with system size. Because the latter cannot be easily varied in simulations, our method instead uses information obtained from observation windows of different sizes to accurately distinguish phase coexistence from structured homogeneous phases. This approach is built on very general physical principles, and will be beneficial to future studies of the phase behavior of multicomponent lipid bilayers.","Title: The Excess Chemical Potential of Water at the Interface with a Protein from Endpoint Simulations

Abstract: We use endpoint simulations to estimate the excess chemical potential of water in the homogeneous liquid and at the interface with a protein in solution. When the pure liquid is taken as the reference, the excess chemical potential of interfacial water is the difference between the solvation free energy of a water molecule at the interface and in the bulk. Using the homogeneous liquid as an example, we show that the solvation free energy for growing a water molecule can be estimated by applying UWHAM to the simulation data generated from the initial and final states (i.e., “the endpoints”) instead of multi-state free energy perturbation simulations because of the possible overlaps of the configurations sampled at the endpoints. Then endpoint simulations are used to estimate the solvation free energy of water at the interface with a protein in solution. The estimate of the solvation free energy at the interface from two simulations at the endpoints agrees with the benchmark using 32 states within 95% confidence interval for most interfacial locations. The ability to accurately estimate the excess chemical potential of water from end point simulations facilitates the statistical thermodynamic analysis of diverse interfacial phenomena. Our focus is on analyzing the excess chemical potential of water at protein receptor binding sites with the goal of using this information to assist in the design of tight binding ligands.

Abstract
Following our recent theoretical prediction of the giant thermo-osmotic response of the water-graphene interface, we explore the practical implementation of waste heat harvesting with carbon-based membranes, focusing on model membranes of carbon nanotubes (CNT). To that aim we combine molecular dynamics simulations and an analytical model considering the details of hydrodynamics in the membrane and at the tube entrances. The analytical model and the simulation results match quantitatively, highlighting the need to take into account both thermodynamics and hydrodynamics to predict thermo-osmotic flows through membranes. We show that, despite viscous entrance effects and a thermal short-circuit mechanism, CNT membranes can generate very fast thermo-osmotic flows, which can overcome the osmotic pressure of seawater. We then show that in small tubes, confinement has a complex effect on the flow and can even reverse the flow direction. Beyond CNT membranes, our analytical model can guide the search for other membranes to generate fast and robust thermo-osmotic flows.

Our previous study showed that the phosphorylation of a highly conserved serine residue, Ser16in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) capsid (CA) protein is promoted by virion-incorporated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) and required for proper peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (Pin1)-mediated uncoating. Interestingly, western blot analysis demonstrated that phosphorylated/activated mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2), the upstream activator of ERK2, as well as ERK2 are incorporated into virions. Here, we show that the MEK1/2 selective allosteric inhibitor Trametinib reduces HIV-1 infectivity via the decrease in virion-incorporated ERK2 phosphorylation. The treatment of chronic HIV-1-infected T-cell line, CEM/LAV-1 cells with Trametinib results in a decrease in ERK2 phosphorylation in the virions. The viruses have relatively low infectivity and impaired reverse transcription. Cell-based fate-of-capsid uncoating assay showed that the reduction in infectivity was caused by a functional impairment of the uncoating process. Furthermore, the viruses from Trametinib-treated CEM/LAV-1 cells also showed decreased reverse transcription efficiency and attenuated multiple rounds of replication in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Taken together, these findings suggest that Trametinib suppresses HIV-1 replication by abrogating the proper disassembly of CA core.","Title: Density functional tight-binding and infrequent metadynamics can capture entropic effects in intramolecular hydrogen transfer reactions

Abstract: Infrequent metadynamics uses biased simulations to estimate the unbiased kinetics of a system, facilitating the calculation of rates and barriers. Here the method is applied to study intramolecular hydrogen transfer reactions involving peroxy radicals, a class of reactions that is challenging to model due to the entropic contributions of the formation of ring structures in the transition state. Using the self-consistent charge density-functional based tight-binding (DFTB) method, we applied infrequent metadynamics to the study of four intramolecular H-transfer reactions, demonstrating that the method can qualitatively reproduce these high entropic contributions, as observed in experiments and those predicted by transition state theory modeled by higher levels of theory. We also show that infrequent metadynamics and DFTB are successful in describing the relationship between transition state ring size and kinetic coefficients (e.g., activation energies and the pre-exponential factors).

Abstract
Sharp increase in macromolecular crowding induces abnormal chromatin compaction in the cell nucleus, suggesting its non-negligible impact on chromatin structure and function. However, the details of the crowding-induced chromatin compaction remain poorly understood. In this work, we present a computer simulation study on the entropic effect of macromolecular crowding on the interaction between chromatin structural units called nucleosome clutches. Nucleosome clutches were modeled by a chain of nucleosomes collapsed by harmonic restraints implicitly mimicking the nucleosome association mediated by histone tails and linker histones. The nucleosome density of the clutches was set close to either that of high-density heterochromatin or that of low-density euchromatin. The effective interactions between these nucleosome clutches were calculated in various crowding conditions, and it was found that the increase in the degree of macromolecular crowding induced attractive interaction between two clutches with high nucleosome density. Interestingly, the increased degree of macromolecular crowding did not induce any attraction between two clutches with low nucleosome density. Our results suggest that the entropic effect of macromolecular crowding can enhance binding between nucleosome clutches in heterochromatin, but not in euchromatin, as a result of the difference in nucleosome packing degrees.","Meng, Y., C.

J. Chem. Theory Comput. : acs.jctc.7b01170.

Understanding protein conformational variability remains a challenge in drug discovery. The issue arises in protein kinases, whose multiple conformational states can affect the binding of small-molecule inhibitors. To overcome this challenge, we propose a comprehensive computational framework based on Markov State Models (MSMs). Our framework integrates the information from explicit-solvent molecular dynamics simulations to accurately rank-order the accessible conformational variants of a target protein. We tested the methodology using Abl kinase with a reference and blind-test set. Only half of the Abl conformational variants discovered by our approach are present in the disclosed X-ray structures. The approach successfully identified a protein conformational state not previously observed in public structures, but evident in a retrospective analysis of Lilly in-house structures: the X-ray structure of Abl with WHI-P154. Using MSM-derived model, the free energy landscape and kinetic profile of Abl was analyzed in detail highlighting opportunities for targeting the unique metastable states.","Using reweighting and free energy surface interpolation to predict solid-solid phase diagrams editors-pick

Many physical properties of small organic molecules are dependent on the current crystal packing, or polymorph, of the material, including bioavailability of pharmaceuticals, optical properties of dyes, and charge transport properties of semiconductors. Predicting the most stable crystalline form at a given temperature and pressure requires determining the crystalline form with the lowest relative Gibbs free energy. Effective computational prediction of the most stable polymorph could save significant time and effort in the design of novel molecular crystalline solids or predict their behavior under new conditions. In this study, we introduce a new approach using multistate reweighting to address the problem of determining solid-solid phase diagrams and apply this approach to the phase diagram of solid benzene. For this approach, we perform sampling at a selection of temperature and pressure states in the region of interest. We use multistate reweighting methods to determine the reduced free energy differences between T and P states within a given polymorph and validate this phase diagram using several measures. The relative stability of the polymorphs at the sampled states can be successively interpolated from these points to create the phase diagram by combining these reduced free energy differences with a reference Gibbs free energy difference between polymorphs. The method also allows for straightforward estimation of uncertainties in the phase boundary. We also find that when properly implemented, multistate reweighting for phase diagram determination scales better with the size of the system than previously estimated.","Aytenfisu, A.

Abstract
Inspired by recent successes using single-stranded DNA tiles to produce complex structures, we develop a two-step coarse-graining approach that uses detailed thermodynamic calculations with oxDNA, a nucleotide-based model of DNA, to parametrize a coarser kinetic model that can reach the time and length scales needed to study the assembly mechanisms of these structures. We test the model by performing a detailed study of the assembly pathways for a two-dimensional target structure made up of 334 unique strands each of which are 42 nucleotides long. Without adjustable parameters, the model reproduces a critical temperature for the formation of the assembly that is close to the temperature at which assembly first occurs in experiments. Furthermore, the model allows us to investigate in detail the nucleation barriers and the distribution of critical nucleus shapes for the assembly of a single target structure. The assembly intermediates are compact and highly connected (although not maximally so), and classical nucleation theory provides a good fit to the height and shape of the nucleation barrier at temperatures close to where assembly first occurs.
","Structure versus stochasticity – The role of molecular crowding and intrinsic disorder in membrane fission. Wilton T. Snead and Jeanne C. Stachowiak. J Mol Biol. 2018. In Press. DOI: 10.1016/j.jmb.2018.03.024

Cellular membranes must undergo remodeling to facilitate critical functions including membrane trafficking, organelle biogenesis, and cell division. An essential step in membrane remodeling is membrane fission, in which an initially continuous membrane surface is divided into multiple, separate compartments. The established view has been that membrane fission requires proteins with conserved structural features such as helical scaffolds, hydrophobic insertions, and polymerized assemblies. In this review we discuss these structure-based fission mechanisms and highlight recent findings from several groups that support an alternative, structure-independent mechanism of membrane fission. This mechanism relies on lateral collisions among crowded, membrane-bound proteins to generate sufficient steric pressure to drive membrane vesiculation. As a stochastic process, this mechanism contrasts with the paradigm that deterministic protein structures are required to drive fission, raising the prospect that many more proteins may participate in fission than previously thought. Paradoxically, our recent work suggests that intrinsically disordered domains may be among the most potent drivers of membrane fission, owing to their large hydrodynamic radii and substantial chain entropy. This stochastic view of fission also suggests new roles for the structure-based fission proteins. Specifically, we hypothesize that in addition to driving fission directly, the canonical fission machines may facilitate the enrichment and organization of bulky disordered protein domains in order to promote membrane fission by locally amplifying protein crowding.","Probing spatial locality in ionic liquids with the grand canonical adaptive resolution molecular dynamics technique

We employ the Grand Canonical Adaptive Resolution Simulation (GC-AdResS) molecular dynamics technique to test the spatial locality of the 1-ethyl 3-methyl imidazolium chloride liquid. In GC-AdResS, atomistic details are kept only in an open sub-region of the system while the environment is treated at coarse-grained level; thus, if spatial quantities calculated in such a sub-region agree with the equivalent quantities calculated in a full atomistic simulation, then the atomistic degrees of freedom outside the sub-region play a negligible role. The size of the sub-region fixes the degree of spatial locality of a certain quantity. We show that even for sub-regions whose radius corresponds to the size of a few molecules, spatial properties are reasonably reproduced thus suggesting a higher degree of spatial locality, a hypothesis put forward also by other researchers and that seems to play an important role for the characterization of fundamental properties of a large class of ionic liquids.

Preprint. DOI: 10.1101/297895
One challenge in current cell biology is to decipher the biophysical mechanisms governing protein enrichment on curved membranes and the resulting membrane deformation. The ERM protein ezrin is abundant and associated with cellular membranes that are flat or with positive or negative curvatures. Using in vitro and cell biology approaches, we assess mechanisms of ezrin’s enrichment on curved membranes. We evidence that ezrin (ezrinWT) and its phosphomimetic mutant T567D (ezrinTD) do not deform membranes but self-assemble anti-parallelly, zipping adjacent membranes. EzrinTD’s specific conformation reduces intermolecular ezrin interactions, allows binding to actin filaments, and promotes ezrin binding to positively curved membranes. While neither ezrinTD nor ezrinWT senses negative membrane curvature alone, we demonstrate that interacting with curvature sensors I-BAR-domain proteins facilitates ezrin enrichment in negatively curved membrane protrusions. Overall, our work reveals new mechanisms, specific conformation or binding to a curvature sensor partner, for targeting curvature insensitive proteins to curved membranes.","Accelerated Enveloping Distribution Sampling: Enabling Sampling of Multiple End-States While Preserving Local Energy Minima

Jan Walther Perthold and Chris Oostenbrink The Journal of Physical Chemistry B Just Accepted Manuscript DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b02725

Enveloping distribution sampling (EDS) is an efficient approach to calculate multiple free-energy differences from a single molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. However, the construction of an appropriate reference state Hamiltonian that samples all states efficiently is not straightforward. We propose a novel approach for the construction of the EDS reference state Hamiltonian, related to a previously described procedure to smoothen energy landscapes. In contrast to previously suggested EDS approaches, our reference-state Hamiltonian preserves local energy minima of the combined end-states. Moreover, we propose an intuitive, robust and efficient parameter optimization scheme to tune EDS Hamiltonian parameters. We demonstrate the proposed method with established and novel test systems and conclude that our approach allows for the automated calculation of multiple free-energy differences from a single simulation. Accelerated EDS promises to be a robust and user-friendly method to compute free-energy differences based on solid statistical mechanics.","Bhati, A. P.; Wan, S.; Hu, Y.; Sherborne, B.; Coveney, P.

The dynamics of biomolecules in the plasma membrane is of fundamental importance to understanding cellular processes. Cellular signaling often starts with extracellular ligand binding to a membrane receptor, which then transduces an intracellular signal. Ligand binding and receptor-complex activation often involve a complex rearrangement of proteins in the membrane, which results in changes in diffusion properties. Two widely used methods to characterize biomolecular diffusion are single-particle tracking (SPT) and imaging total internal reflection fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (ITIR-FCS). Here, we compare the results of recovered diffusion coefficients and mean-square displacements of the two methods by simulations of free, domain-confined, or meshwork diffusion. We introduce, to our knowledge, a new method for the determination of confinement radii from ITIR-FCS data. We further establish and demonstrate simultaneous SPT/ITIR-FCS for direct comparison within living cells. Finally, we compare the results obtained by SPT and ITIR-FCS for the receptor tyrosine kinase MET. Our results show that SPT and ITIR-FCS yield complementary information on diffusion properties of biomolecules in cell membranes.","Entangled trajectories Hamiltonian dynamics for treating quantum nuclear effects

Brendan Smith and Alexey V. Akimov The Journal of Chemical Physics 148, 144106 (2018); https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5022573

A simple and robust methodology, dubbed Entangled Trajectories Hamiltonian Dynamics (ETHD), is developed to capture quantum nuclear effects such as tunneling and zero-point energy through the coupling of multiple classical trajectories. The approach reformulates the classically mapped second-order Quantized Hamiltonian Dynamics (QHD-2) in terms of coupled classical trajectories. The method partially enforces the uncertainty principle and facilitates tunneling. The applicability of the method is demonstrated by studying the dynamics in symmetric double well and cubic metastable state potentials. The methodology is validated using exact quantum simulations and is compared to QHD-2. We illustrate its relationship to the rigorous Bohmian quantum potential approach, from which ETHD can be derived. Our simulations show a remarkable agreement of the ETHD calculation with the quantum results, suggesting that ETHD may be a simple and inexpensive way of including quantum nuclear effects in molecular dynamics simulations.

Abstract:
Combined-resolution simulations are an effective way to study molecular properties across a range of length and time scales. These simulations can benefit from adaptive boundaries that allow the high-resolution region to adapt (change size and/or shape) as the simulation progresses. The number of degrees of freedom required to accurately represent even a simple molecular process can vary by several orders of magnitude throughout the course of a simulation, and adaptive boundaries react to these changes to include an appropriate but not excessive amount of detail. Here, we derive the Hamiltonian and distribution function for such a molecular simulation. We also design an algorithm that can efficiently sample the boundary as a new coordinate of the system. We apply this framework to a mixed explicit/continuum simulation of a peptide in solvent. We use this example to discuss the conditions necessary for a successful implementation of adaptive boundaries that is both efficient and accurate in reproducing molecular properties.

Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) provides a tool for studying phase behavior and interfacial phenomena for complex mixtures and macromolecules. Methods to quickly and automatically parameterize DPD greatly increase its effectiveness. One such method is to map predicted activity coefficients derived from COSMO-SAC onto DPD parameter sets. However, there are serious limitations to the accuracy of this mapping, including the inability of single DPD beads to reproduce asymmetric infinite dilution activity coefficients, the loss of precision when reusing parameters for different molecular fragments, and the error due to bonding beads together. This report describes these effects in quantitative detail and provides methods to mitigate much of their deleterious effects. This includes a novel approach to remove errors caused by bonding DPD beads together. Using these methods, logarithm hexane/water partition coefficients were calculated for 61 molecules. The root mean-squared error for these calculations was determined to be 0.14—a very low value—with respect to the final mapping procedure. Cognizance of the above limitations can greatly enhance the predictive power of DPD.

Abstract: We report a numerical study of the statistical properties of the potential energy landscape of TIP4P/2005, one of the most accurate rigid water models. We show that, in the region where equili- brated configurations can be generated, a Gaussian landscape description is able to properly describe the model properties. We also find that the volume dependence of the landscape properties is con- sistent with the existence of a locus of density maxima in the phase diagram. The landscape-based equation of state accurately reproduces the TIP4P/2005 pressure-vs-volume curves, providing a sound extrapolation of the free-energy at low T. A positive-pressure liquid-liquid critical point is predicted by the resulting free-energy.

To evaluate vibronic spectra beyond the Condon approximation, we extend the on-the-fly ab initio thawed Gaussian approximation by considering the Herzberg-Teller contribution due to the dependence of the electronic transition dipole moment on nuclear coordinates. The extended thawed Gaussian approximation is tested on electronic absorption spectra of phenyl radical and benzene: Calculated spectra reproduce experimental data and are much more accurate than standard global harmonic approaches, confirming the significance of anharmonicity. Moreover, the extended method provides a tool to quantify the Herzberg-Teller contribution: we show that in phenyl radical, anharmonicity outweighs the Herzberg-Teller contribution, whereas in benzene, the Herzberg-Teller contribution is essential, since the transition is electronically forbidden and Condon approximation yields a zero spectrum. Surprisingly, both adiabatic harmonic spectra outperform those of the vertical harmonic model, which describes the Franck-Condon region better. Finally, we provide a simple recipe for orientationally averaging spectra, valid beyond Condon approximation, and a relation among the transition dipole, its gradient, and nonadiabatic coupling vectors.
","A comparative computational study of coarse-grained and all-atom water models in shock Hugoniot states

Sa Hoon Min and Max L. Berkowitz The Journal of Chemical Physics 148, 144504 (2018); https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5011968

We performed molecular dynamics simulations to study how well some of the water models used in simulations describe shocked states. Water in our simulations was described using three different models. One was an often-used all-atom TIP4P/2005 model, while the other two were coarse-grained models used with the MARTINI force field: non-polarizable and polarizable MARTINI water. The all-atom model provided results in good agreement with Hugoniot curves (for data on pressure versus specific volume or, equivalently, on shock wave velocity versus “piston” velocity) describing shocked states in the whole range of pressures (up to 11 GPa) under study. If simulations of shocked states of water using coarse-grained models were performed for short time periods, we observed that data obtained for shocked states at low pressure were fairly accurate compared to experimental Hugoniot curves. Polarizable MARTINI water still provided a good description of Hugoniot curves for pressures up to 11 GPa, while the results for the non-polarizable MARTINI water substantially deviated from the Hugoniot curves. We also calculated the temperature of the Hugoniot states and observed that for TIP4P/2005 water, they were consistent with those from theoretical calculations, while both coarse-grained models predicted much higher temperatures. These high temperatures for MARTINI water can be explained by the loss of degrees of freedom due to coarse-graining procedure.

Abstract:
We present a systematic approach to reduce the dimensionality of a complex molecular system. Starting with a data set of molecular coordinates (obtained from experiment or simulation) and an associated set of metastable conformational states (obtained from clustering the data), a supervised machine learning model is trained to assign unknown molecular structures to the set of metastable states. In this way, the model learns to determine the features of the molecular coordinates that are most important to discriminate the states. Using a new algorithm that exploits this feature importance via an iterative exclusion principle, we identify the essential internal coordinates (such as specific interatomic distances or dihedral angles) of the system, which are shown to represent versatile reaction coordinates that account for the dynamics of the slow degrees of freedom and explain the mechanism of the underlying processes. Moreover, these coordinates give rise to a free energy landscape that may reveal previously hidden intermediate states of the system.

The charge transfer reaction at the electrode/solution interface is regarded as a major component that limits the current densities of Li-ion batteries. A combination of density functional theory for the electronic structure calculations of an electrode and a reacting component with implicit solvation theory for an electrolyte solution is used for the lithium insertion/desorption reaction (<I>R</i>). At the interfaces between tilted-graphite electrodes and a 1 M LiPF<sub>6</sub> ethylene carbonate solution, the energy landscapes of reaction <I>R</i> are revealed under constant electron chemical potential conditions. Across the transition state where the Li forms a half solvation shell, the reacting Li inside the electrode changes to a full solvation structure in the solution accompanied by electron transfer. On graphite with two tilt angles, the activation energies at the equilibrium potentials of reaction <I>R</i> are approximately 0.6 eV, which is consistent with the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements. However, opposite-sign charges are obtained on the two angle surfaces, which can be well explained by the work functions on the tilted graphite. This study paves the way for the quantitative analysis of the charge-transfer reactions in electrochemical devices under electrochemically defined environments.",,

Abstract: In our study, we extend the committor concept on multi-minima systems, where more than one reaction may proceed, but the feasible data evaluation needs the projection onto partial reactions. The elementary reaction committor and the corresponding probability density of the reactive trajectories are defined and calculated on a three-hole two-dimensional model system explored by single-particle Langevin dynamics. We propose a method to visualize more elementary reaction committor functions or probability densities of reactive trajectories on a single plot that helps to identify the most important reaction channels and the nonreactive domains simultaneously. We suggest a weighting for the energy- committor plots that correctly shows the limits of both the minimal energy path and the average energy concepts. The methods also performed well on the analysis of molecular dynamics trajectories of 2-chlorobutane, where an elementary reaction committor, the probability densities, the potential energy/committor, and the free-energy/committor curves are presented.

The distribution and local structural order of hydration water in the proximity of intrinsically disordered proteins/regions are investigated within the frame work of three-dimensional (3D)-reference interaction site model theory. The hydration water distribution around the protein surface is quantified in terms of the 3D distribution function and the water–protein radial distribution function (RDF), whereas the local ordering of water molecules around the protein surface is measured in terms of the tetrahedral order parameter. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical study of the 3D hydration water distribution profiles of disordered proteins. The analysis of the 3D hydration profiles reveals a nonuniform distribution and higher hydration water density around disordered proteins as compared to the globular ones because of their noncompact structures with more solvent-accessible surface area and the abundance of charged residues. This difference is also evident in the residue-specific RDFs of water around different polar and nonpolar atoms of charged and hydrophobic residues of the globular and disordered proteins. The average tetrahedral order parameter evaluated as a function of the water–water distance shows that water molecules are more ordered around disordered regions/proteins because of their higher mean net charge facilitating stronger water–protein interactions","Impacts of the Properties of Anode Solid Electrolyte Interface on the Storage Life of Li-Ion Batteries

Storage life is critically important in applications of rechargeable batteries. The Li loss in graphite is the main causes during the storage ageing at full state of charge while the solid electrolyte interface on the graphite acts as a protective layer to restrain the Li loss during ageing. Focusing on the initial SEI electronic resistance as the rate-limiting factor during the ageing progress, we investigated the properties of the SEIs formed under varied conditions. The main SEI components and corresponding electronic conductivity were analyzed, while the thickness of initial SEIs were estimated at the same time. The storage performance results confirmed that cells with high electronic resistance SEIs would have extended storage lifespan, but the performance should be based on the well-formed SEIs. Cells with incomplete SEIs would have accelerated capacity loss rate during storage aging.

Reference: The Journal of Chemical Physics 148, 241706 (2018); doi: 10.1063/1.5009502 
Abstract: Classical intermolecular potentials typically require an extensive parametrization procedure for any new compound considered. To do away with prior parametrization, we propose a combination of physics-based potentials with machine learning (ML), coined IPML, which is transferable across small neutral organic and biologically relevant molecules. ML models provide on-the-fly predictions for environment-dependent local atomic properties: electrostatic multipole coefficients (significant error reduction compared to previously reported), the population and decay rate of valence atomic densities, and polarizabilities across conformations and chemical compositions of H, C, N, and O atoms. These parameters enable accurate calculations of intermolecular contributions—electrostatics, charge penetration, repulsion, induction/polarization, and many-body dispersion. Unlike other poten- tials, this model is transferable in its ability to handle new molecules and conformations without explicit prior parametrization: All local atomic properties are predicted from ML, leaving only eight global parameters—optimized once and for all across compounds. We validate IPML on various gas- phase dimers at and away from equilibrium separation, where we obtain mean absolute errors between 0.4 and 0.7 kcal/mol for several chemically and conformationally diverse datasets representative of non-covalent interactions in biologically relevant molecules. We further focus on hydrogen-bonded complexes—essential but challenging due to their directional nature—where datasets of DNA base pairs and amino acids yield an extremely encouraging 1.4 kcal/mol error. Finally, and as a first look, we consider IPML for denser systems: water clusters, supramolecular host-guest complexes, and the benzene crystal.

We present here our implementation of a time-reversible, multiple time step (MTS) method for full QM and hybrid QM/MM Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulations. The method relies on a fully flexible combination of electronic structure methods - from Density Functional Theory to wavefunction-based quantum chemistry methods - to evaluate the nuclear forces in the reference and in the correction steps. The possibility of combining different electronic structure methods is based on the observation that exchange and correlation terms only contribute to the low-frequency modes of nuclear forces. We show how a pair of low/high-level electronic structure methods that individually would lead to very different system properties can be efficiently combined in the reference and correction steps of this MTS scheme. The current MTS implementation makes it possible to perform highly accurate ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations at reduced computational cost. Stable and accurate trajectories were obtained with time steps of several femtoseconds, similar and even exceeding the ones usually adopted in classical molecular dynamics, also in particular when using a generalised Langevin stochastic thermostat: Compared to the standard Velocity Verlet integration, the present MTS scheme allows for a 5 to 6-fold overall speedup, at an unaltered level of accuracy.","(1) Carlsson, A.

The connection between specific features in the water X-ray absorption spectrum and X-ray emission spectrum (XES) and the local H-bond coordination is studied based on structures obtained from path-integral molecular dynamics simulations using either the opt-PBE-vdW density functional or the MB-pol force field. Computing the XES spectrum using all molecules in a snapshot results in only one peak in the lone-pair (1b1) region, while the experiment shows two peaks separated by 0.8-0.9 eV. Different H-bond configurations were classified based on the local structure index (LSI) and a geometrical H-bond cone criterion. We find that tetrahedrally coordinated molecules characterized by high LSI values and two strong donated and two strong accepted H-bonds contribute to the low energy 1b1 emission peak and to the post-edge region in absorption. Molecules with the asymmetric H-bond environment with one strong accepted H-bond and one strong donated H-bond and low LSI values give rise to the high energy 1b1 peak in the emission spectrum and mainly contribute to the pre-edge and main-edge in the absorption spectrum. The 1b1peak splitting can be increased to 0.62 eV by imposing constraints on the H-bond length, i.e., for very tetrahedral structures short H-bonds (less than 2.68 Å) and for very asymmetric structures elongated H-bonds (longer than 2.8 Å).

Authors: Ning Zhang, Shaomin Chen, Boyun Yang, Jun Huo, Xiaopeng Zhang, Junjiang Bao, Xuehua Ruan, and Gaohong He 
Abstract: An increasing demand for freshwater inspires further understanding of the mechanism of water diffusion in reverse-osmosis membranes for the development of high-performance membranes for desalination. Water diffusion has a close relationship with the structural and dynamical characteristics of hydrogen bonds, which is not well-understood for the confining environment inside the polyamide membrane at the molecular level. In this work, an atomistic model of a highly cross-linked polyamide membrane was built with an equilibrated mixture of m-phenylenediamine and trimesoyl chloride monomers. The structure and dynamics of water in the regions from the bulk phase to the membrane interior were investigated by molecular dynamics simulations. Explicit hydrogen bond criteria were determined for hydrogen-bonding analysis. The local distribution and orientation of water reveal that the hydrogen-bonding affinity of the hydrophilic functional groups of polymers inhibits water diffusion inside the membrane. The affinity helps to produce percolated water channels across the membrane. The hydrogen-bonding structures of water in different regions indicate dehydration is required for the entry of water into the polyamide membrane, which dominates water flux across the membrane. This paper not only deepens the understanding of the structure and dynamics of water confined in the polyamide membrane but also stimulates the future work on high-performance reverse-osmosis membranes.

Authors: Pascal Hebbeker, Tabea G. Langen, Felix A. Plamper, and Stefanie Schneider
Abstract: The influence of spacer chains on the intramolecular complexation in star-shaped heteroarm (miktoarm) polymers is investigated. To overcome the mutual attraction of different polymeric components present in a miktoarm star with different homopolymeric arms, spacer chains of different length are attached to the core of the star at three different positions. In most of the investigated cases, this leads to diblock copolymer arms within the miktoarm star. Hereby, the inner spacer separates the outer blocks from their attractively interacting homopolymeric arms. The effect on the intramolecular complexation and the structure of the star polymer is obtained by Monte Carlo simulations of a simple bead-spring model. Then, long spacers can completely prevent the complexation. Both, local shielding by the spacer chains and the increased distance between the complex-forming polymers due to the spacer chains inhibit the complex formation. For a range of spacer positions and lengths, an equilibrium between a system forming a complex and a complex free system is found. The spacer chains can be used as a tool to tune the intramolecular complexation.

Authors: Nagma Parveen, Inga Rimkute, Stephan Block, Gustaf E. Rydell, Daniel Midtvedt, Göran Larson, Vesa P. Hytönen, Vladimir P. Zhdanov, Anders Lundgren, and Fredrik Höök
Abstract: Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy have been used to investigate binding of norovirus-like particles (noroVLPs) to a supported (phospho)lipid bilayer (SLB) containing a few percent of H or B type 1 glycosphingolipid (GSL) receptors. Although neither of these GSLs spontaneously form domains, noroVLPs were observed to form micron-sized clusters containing typically up to about 30 VLP copies, especially for B type 1, which is a higher-affinity receptor. This novel finding is explained by proposing a model implying that VLP-induced membrane deformation promotes VLP clustering, a hypothesis that was further supported by observing that functionalized gold nanoparticles were able to locally induce SLB deformation. Because similar effects are likely possible also at cellular membranes, our findings are interesting beyond a pure biophysicochemical perspective as they shed new light on what may happen during receptor-mediated uptake of viruses as well as nanocarriers in drug delivery.

"Thermodynamics and structural transition of binary atomic Bose-Fermi mixtures in box or harmonic potentials: A path-integral study
Tom Kim and Chih-Chun Chien
Phys. Rev. A 97, 033628 – Published 29 March 2018

Experimental realizations of a variety of atomic binary Bose-Fermi mixtures have brought opportunities for studying composite quantum systems with different spin statistics. The binary atomic mixtures can exhibit a structural transition from a mixture into phase separation as the boson-fermion interaction increases. By using a path-integral formalism to evaluate the grand partition function and the thermodynamic grand potential, we obtain the effective potential of binary Bose-Fermi mixtures. Thermodynamic quantities in a broad range of temperatures and interactions are also derived. The structural transition can be identified as a loop of the effective potential curve, and the volume fraction of phase separation can be determined by the lever rule. For 6Li−7Li and 6Li−41K mixtures, we present the phase diagrams of the mixtures in a box potential at zero and finite temperatures. Due to the flexible densities of atomic gases, the construction of phase separation is more complicated when compared to conventional liquid or solid mixtures where the individual densities are fixed. For harmonically trapped mixtures, we use the local density approximation to map out the finite-temperature density profiles and present typical trap structures, including the mixture, partially separated phases, and fully separated phases.","Quantum decimation in Hilbert space: Coarse graining without structure
Ashmeet Singh and Sean M. Carroll
Phys. Rev. A 97, 032111 – Published 14 March 2018
We present a technique to coarse grain quantum states in a finite-dimensional Hilbert space. Our method is distinguished from other approaches by not relying on structures such as a preferred factorization of Hilbert space or a preferred set of operators (local or otherwise) in an associated algebra. Rather, we use the data corresponding to a given set of states, either specified independently or constructed from a single state evolving in time. Our technique is based on principle component analysis (PCA), and the resulting coarse-grained quantum states live in a lower-dimensional Hilbert space whose basis is defined using the underlying (isometric embedding) transformation of the set of fine-grained states we wish to coarse grain. Physically, the transformation can be interpreted to be an “entanglement coarse-graining” scheme that retains most of the global, useful entanglement structure of each state, while needing fewer degrees of freedom for its reconstruction. This scheme could be useful for efficiently describing collections of states whose number is much smaller than the dimension of Hilbert space, or a single state evolving over time.",,,"Reinforced dynamics for enhanced sampling in large atomic and molecular systems

Abstract:
A new approach for efficiently exploring the configuration space and computing the free energy of large atomic and molecular systems is proposed, motivated by an analogy with reinforcement learning. There are two major components in this new approach. Like metadynamics, it allows for an efficient exploration of the configuration space by adding an adaptively computed biasing potential to the original dynamics. Like deep reinforcement learning, this biasing potential is trained on the fly using deep neural networks, with data collected judiciously from the exploration and an uncertainty indicator from the neural network model playing the role of the reward function. Parameterization using neural networks makes it feasible to handle cases with a large set of collective variables. This has the potential advantage that selecting precisely the right set of collective variables has now become less critical for capturing the structural transformations of the system. The method is illustrated by studying the full-atom explicit solvent models of alanine dipeptide and tripeptide, as well as the system of a polyalanine-10 molecule with 20 collective variables.

"Multiscale Coarse-Graining with Effective Polarizabilities: A fully bottom-up approach, Patrick Gerard Lafond and Sergei Izvekov, J. Chem. Theory Comput., DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00917, Coarse-grain (CG) models offer a way to estimate the behavior of larger systems, for longer times than possible in fine-grain calculations by eliminating fine detail. For most atomistic models this often involves eliminating electrostatic interactions, yet, in many calculations, the dielectric properties of a material may be too important to ignore. In this work, we expand upon a previous CG representation which preserves the instantaneous center of mass (CoM), charge, and dipole of clusters of atoms by representing them with charged dimers. We then derive a formal mapping of the microscopic coordinates onto the CG representation allowing for a fully bottom-up construction of the CG force field that statistically matches the CoM, and first two terms of the multipole expansion. In the method presented here, unlike any previous bottom-up mappings, the atomistic particles are fractionally mapped to both sites in the dimer representation. Despite this difference, we show that the corresponding coordinate transformation augmented with a dipole moment mapping can be constructed as a canonical transformation and hence can derive correct ensemble statistics in the associated force mapping. The method is tested on nitromethane at a sub-molecular resolution, where the nitro group is represented through a charged dimer while the methyl group is a standard CoM projection, next we test a lower resolution of nitromethane where the entire molecule is represented as a single dimer. At the high resolution we showed the method can be mixed with standard CoM projections, and give rise to intramolecular interactions. After nitromethane, we test the method at a supra-molecular level using an aggressive scheme of 10 water molecules to one CG dimer. We find in all cases the CoM-CoM radial distribution functions are well matched, and the dipole distributions are matched. For the sub-molecular nitromethane we find the model is transferable to simulations with external fields, and with the single-dimer nitromethane, we see the dipole-dipole correlation function is matched, but we find the frequency dependent dielectric constant significantly deviates indicating enhanced kinetics as commonly seen in CG molecular dynamics. Lastly, for water we see some discrepancy in the dipole-dipole correlation function that stems from the pairwise decomposition of forces rather than the mapping method presented here.","BOCS: Bottom-up Open-source Coarse-graining Software

We present the BOCS toolkit as a suite of open source software tools for parametrizing bottom-up coarse-grained (CG) models to accurately reproduce structural and thermodynamic properties of high-resolution models. The BOCS toolkit complements available software packages by providing robust implementations of both the multiscale coarse-graining (MS-CG) force-matching method and also the generalized-Yvon–Born–Green (g-YBG) method. The g-YBG method allows one to analyze and to calculate MS-CG potentials in terms of structural correlations. Additionally, the BOCS toolkit implements an extended ensemble framework for optimizing the transferability of bottom-up potentials, as well as a self-consistent pressure-matching method for accurately modeling the pressure equation of state for homogeneous systems. We illustrate these capabilities by parametrizing transferable potentials for CG models that accurately model the structure, pressure, and compressibility of liquid alkane systems and by quantifying the role of many-body correlations in determining the calculated pair potential for a one-site CG model of liquid methanol.","Protein Hydration Thermodynamics: The Influence of Flexibility and Salt on Hydrophobin II Hydration, Richard C. Remsing, Erte Xi, and Amish J. Patel, Journal of Physical Chemistry B, DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12060, February 2, 2018 (web), The solubility of proteins and other macromolecular solutes plays an important role in numerous biological, chemical, and medicinal processes. An important determinant of protein solubility is the solvation free energy of the protein, which quantifies the overall strength of the interactions between the protein and the aqueous solution that surrounds it. Here we present an all-atom explicit-solvent computational framework for the rapid estimation of protein solvation free energies. Using this framework, we estimate the hydration free energy of hydrophobin II, an amphiphilic fungal protein, in a computationally efficient manner. We further explore how the protein hydration free energy is influenced by enhancing flexibility and by the addition of sodium chloride, and find that it increases in both cases, making protein hydration less favorable.","Accuracy Comparison of Generalized Born Models in the Calculation of Electrostatic Binding Free Energies

DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00886

The need for accurate yet effi cient representation of the aqueous environment in biomolecular modeling has led to the development of a variety of generalized Born (GB) implicit solvent models. While many studies have focused on the accuracy of available GB models in predicting solvation free energies, a systematic assessment of the quality of these models in binding free energy calculations, crucial for rational drug design, has not been undertaken. Here, we evaluate the accuracies of eight common GB flavors (GB-HCT, GB-OBC, GB-neck2, GBNSR6, GBSW, GBMV1, GBMV2, and GBMV3), available in major molecular dynamics packages, in predicting the electrostatic binding free energies (ΔΔGel ) for a diverse set of 60 biomolecular complexes belonging to four main classes: protein− protein, protein-drug, RNA-peptide, and small complexes. The GB flavors are examined in terms of their ability to reproduce the results from the Poisson− Boltzmann (PB) model, commonly used as accuracy reference in this context. We show that the agreement with the PB of ΔΔGel  estimates varies widely between different GB models and also across different types of biomolecular complexes, with R2  correlations ranging from 0.3772 to 0.9986. A surface-based “ R6”  GB model recently implemented in AMBER shows the closest overall agreement with reference PB (R2  = 0.9949, RMSD = 8.75 kcal/mol). The RNA-peptide and protein-drug complex sets appear to be most challenging for all but one model, as indicated by the large deviations from the PB in ΔΔGel . Small neutral complexes present the least challenge for most of the GB models tested. The quantitative demonstration of the strengths and weaknesses of the GB models across the diverse complex types provided here can be used as a guide for practical computations and future development efforts.","Unsupervised Calculation of Free Energy Barriers in Large Crystalline Systems

Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 135503 – Published 29 March 2018
Abstract:
The calculation of free energy differences for thermally activated mechanisms in the solid state are routinely hindered by the inability to define a set of collective variable functions that accurately describe the mechanism under study. Even when possible, the requirement of descriptors for each mechanism under study prevents implementation of free energy calculations in the growing range of automated material simulation schemes. We provide a solution, deriving a path-based, exact expression for free energy differences in the solid state which does not require a converged reaction pathway, collective variable functions, Gram matrix evaluations, or probability flux-based estimators. The generality and efficiency of our method is demonstrated on a complex transformation of C15 interstitial defects in iron and double kink nucleation on a screw dislocation in tungsten, the latter system consisting of more than 120 000 atoms. Both cases exhibit significant anharmonicity under experimentally relevant temperatures.

Cell state determination is the outcome of intrinsically stochastic biochemical reactions. Transitions between such states are studied as noise-driven escape problems in the chemical species space. Escape can occur via multiple possible multidimensional paths, with probabilities depending nonlocally on the noise. Here we characterize the escape from an oscillatory biochemical state by minimizing the Freidlin-Wentzell action, deriving from it the stochastic spiral exit path from the limit cycle. We also use the minimized action to infer the escape time probability density function.",,"Paz, S. A.; Maragliano, L.; Abrams, C.

"Hydration dynamics of a lipid membrane: Hydrogen bond networks and lipid-lipid associations, Abhinav Srivastava and Ananya Debnath, The Journal of Chemical Physics 148, 094901 (2018), Dynamics of hydration layers of a dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) bilayer are investigated using an all atom molecular dynamics simulation. Based upon the geometric criteria, continuously residing interface water molecules which form hydrogen bonds solely among themselves and then concertedly hydrogen bonded to carbonyl, phosphate, and glycerol head groups of DMPC are identified. The interface water hydrogen bonded to lipids shows slower relaxation rates for translational and rotational dynamics compared to that of the bulk water and is found to follow sub-diffusive and non-diffusive behaviors, respectively. The mean square displacements and the reorientational auto-correlation functions are slowest for the interfacial waters hydrogen bonded to the carbonyl oxygen since these are buried deep in the hydrophobic core among all interfacial water studied. The intermittent hydrogen bond auto-correlation functions are calculated, which allows breaking and reformations of the hydrogen bonds. The auto-correlation functions for interfacial hydrogen bonded networks develop humps during a transition from cage-like motion to eventual power law behavior of t−3/2. The asymptotic t−3/2 behavior indicates translational diffusion dictated dynamics during hydrogen bond breaking and formation irrespective of the nature of the chemical confinement. Employing reactive flux correlation analysis, the forward rate constant of hydrogen bond breaking and formation is calculated which is used to obtain Gibbs energy of activation of the hydrogen bond breaking. The relaxation rates of the networks buried in the hydrophobic core are slower than the networks near the lipid-water interface which is again slower than bulk due to the higher Gibbs energy of activation. Since hydrogen bond breakage follows a translational diffusion dictated mechanism, chemically confined hydrogen bond networks need an activation energy to diffuse through water depleted hydrophobic environments. Our calculations reveal that the slow relaxation rates of interfacial waters in the vicinity of lipids are originated from the chemical confinement of concerted hydrogen bond networks. The analysis suggests that the networks in the hydration layer of membranes dynamically facilitate the water mediated lipid-lipid associations which can provide insights on the thermodynamic stability of soft interfaces relevant to biological systems in the future","Stretch-Induced Interdigitation of a Phospholipid/Cholesterol Bilayer

DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b10633

The interdigitated gel (LβI) phase is one of the membrane phases of phospholipid molecules in which the hydrophobic tails of the phospholipid molecules penetrate the opposite leaflet of the bilayer. Recent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have shown that interdigitation can take place as a phase transition from the liquid-ordered (Lo) phase to the LβI phase under stretching. However, there is still no conclusive experimental evidence for this process, so its existence remains controversial. In this study, to explain the transition from energy balance, we propose a free-energy model. The model consists of three energy components: the elastic deformation energy, surface energy at the bilayer–water interface, and interphase boundary energy. To determine the parameters of the model, we perform MD simulations of a stretched 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine/cholesterol bilayer. The phase diagrams from our model are in good agreement with those obtained from MD simulations. The energy balance among the components in the stretched bilayer quantitatively explains the stretch-induced transition. In the model, increasing the system size to that used in experiments shows that interdigitation is favorable for rigid bilayers under stretching or in alcohol solutions. These results suggest that the stretch-induced interdigitation might be observed in microscopic experiments.","Statistical Model to Decipher Protein Folding/Unfolding at a Local Scale, Paul Grassein, Patrice Delarue, Harold A. Scheraga, Gia G. Maisuradze and Patrick Senet, Journal of Physical Chemistry B, DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b10733, February 15, 2018 (web), Protein folding/unfolding can be analyzed experimentally at a local scale by monitoring the physical properties of local probes as a function of the temperature, for example, the distance between fluorophores or the values of chemical shifts of backbone atoms. Here, the analytical Lifson–Roig model for the helix–coil transition is modified to analyze local thermal unfolding of the fast-folder W protein of bacteriophage lambda (gpW) simulated by all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in explicit solvent at 15 different temperatures. The protein structure is described by the coarse-grained dihedral angles (γ) and bond angles (θ) built between successive Cα–Cαvirtual bonds. Each (γ,θ) pair serves as a local probe of protein unfolding. Local native/non-native states are defined for each pair of (γ,θ) angles by analyzing the free-energy landscapes ΔG(γ,θ) computed from MD trajectories. The three local elementary equilibrium constants of the model are extracted for each (γ,θ) pair along the sequence from MD simulations, and the model predictions are compared to the MD data. Using only the local equilibrium constants as an input, we show that the local denaturation curves computed from the model partition function fit their MD simulated counterparts in a satisfying manner without any adjustment. In the model and MD simulations, gpW unfolds gradually between 320 and 340 K, with an average native percentage decreasing from 0.8 (320 K) to 0.2 (340 K). In the prism of the model, there is no stable structure at the local scale in this 20 K unfolding temperature range. The enthalpy change upon local unfolding computed from the model and from MD trajectories suggests that the unfolded state between 320 and 340 K corresponds to a dynamical equilibrium between a large ensemble of constantly changing structures. The present results confirm the downhill unfolding of gpW, which does not obey a two-state global folding/unfolding model, and shed light on the interpretation of local denaturation curves.","Ordering Protein Contact Matrices

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2018.03.001

Numerous biophysical approaches provide information about residues spatial proximity in proteins. However, correct assignment of the protein fold from this proximity information is not straightforward if the spatially close protein residues are not assigned to residues in the primary sequence. Here, we propose an algorithm to assign such residue numbers by ordering the columns and lines of the raw protein contact matrix directly obtained from proximity information between unassigned amino acids. The ordering problem is formatted as the search of a trail within a graph connecting protein residues through the nonzero contact values. The algorithm performs in two steps: (i) finding the longest trail of the graph using an original dynamic programming algorithm, (ii) clustering the individual ordered matrices using a self-organizing map (SOM) approach. The combination of the dynamic programming and self-organizing map approaches constitutes a quite innovative point of the present work. The algorithm was validated on a set of about 900 proteins, representative of the sizes and proportions of secondary structures observed in the Protein Data Bank. The algorithm was revealed to be efficient for noise levels up to 40%, obtaining average gaps of about 20% at maximum between ordered and initial matrices. The proposed approach paves the ways toward a method of fold prediction from noisy proximity information, as TMscores larger than 0.5 have been obtained for ten randomly chosen proteins, in the case of a noise level of 10%. The methods has been also validated on two experimental cases, on which it performed satisfactorily","van der Munnik, N. P.; Sajib, M. S. J.; Moss, M. A.; Wei, T.; Uline, M.

As $N$ increases, we find ordered regions of high and low particle density, with the highest density near the boundary for all particle and cavity shape combinations.

Abstract        
Coarse-grained models of polymer and biomolecular systems have enabled the computational study of cooperative phenomena, e.g., self-assembly, by lumping multiple atomistic degrees of freedom along the backbone of a polymer, lipid, or DNA molecule into one effective coarse-grained interaction center. Such a coarse-graining strategy leaves the number of molecules unaltered. In order to treat the surrounding solvent or counterions on the same coarse-grained level of description, one can also stochastically group several of those small molecules into an effective, coarse-grained solvent bead or “fluid element.” Such a procedure reduces the number of molecules, and we discuss how to compensate the concomitant loss of translational entropy by density-dependent interactions in spatially inhomogeneous systems.

Soft Matter, Advance Article (2018) doi: 10.1039/C7SM02188G
We investigated the effects of lipid geometry on vesicle division using coarse grained molecular dynamics simulations. When the vesicle is composed of zero and negative spontaneous curvature lipids (ZSLs and NSLs), the difference in their molecular spontaneous curvatures destabilizes the neck of the limiting shape vesicle. In the vesicle division pathway, the neck developed into the stalk intermediates. The stalk was broken when the NSLs were expelled from the stalk. Free energy analysis shows that the coupling between the lipid geometry and the Gaussian rigidity is responsible for the observed vesicle division.","Applying Pose Clustering and MD Simulations To Eliminate False Positives in Molecular Docking

DOI: 10.1021/acs.jcim.7b00588

 In this work, we developed a computational protocol that employs multiple molecular docking experiments, followed by pose clustering, molecular dynamic simulations (10 ns), and energy rescoring to produce reliable 3D models of antibody− carbohydrate complexes. The protocol was applied to 10 antibody− carbohydrate cocomplexes and three unliganded (apo) antibodies. Pose clustering signifi cantly reduced the number of potential poses. For each system, 15 or fewer clusters out of 100 initial poses were generated and chosen for further analysis. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations allowed the docked poses to either converge or disperse, and rescoring increased the likelihood that the best-ranked pose was an acceptable pose. This approach is amenable to automation and can be a valuable aid in determining the structure of antibody− carbohydrate complexes provided there is no major side chain rearrangement or backbone conformational change in the H3 loop of the CDR regions. Further, the basic protocol of docking a small ligand to a known binding site, clustering the results, and performing MD with a suitable force fi eld is applicable to any protein ligand system.

The N-terminal amphipathic helix of Pex11p self-interacts to induce membrane remodelling during peroxisome fission. Juanjuan Sua, Ann S.

Pex11p plays a crucial role in peroxisome fission. Previously, it was shown that a conserved N-terminal amphipathic helix in Pex11p, termed Pex11-Amph, was necessary for peroxisomal fission in vivo while in vitro studies revealed that this region alone was sufficient to bring about tubulation of liposomes with a lipid consistency resembling the peroxisomal membrane. However, molecular details of how Pex11-Amph remodels the peroxisomal membrane remain unknown. Here we have combined in silico, in vitro and in vivo approaches to gain insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying Pex11-Amph activity. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we observe that Pex11-Amph peptides form linear aggregates on a model membrane. Furthermore, we identify mutations that disrupted this aggregation in silico, which also abolished the peptide's ability to remodel liposomes in vitro, establishing that Pex11p oligomerisation plays a direct role in membrane remodelling. In vivo studies revealed that these mutations resulted in a strong reduction in Pex11 protein levels, indicating that these residues are important for Pex11p function. Taken together, our data demonstrate the power of combining in silicotechniques with experimental approaches to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying Pex11p-dependent membrane remodelling.","Gradient-based stochastic estimation of the density matrix

Zhentao Wang, Gia-Wei Chern, Cristian D. Batista, and Kipton Barros

Fast estimation of the single-particle density matrix is key to many applications in quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics. The best numerical methods leverage the fact that the density matrix elements f(H)ij decay rapidly with distance rij between orbitals. This decay is usually exponential. However, for the special case of metals at zero temperature, algebraic decay of the density matrix appears and poses a significant numerical challenge. We introduce a gradient-based probing method to estimate all local density matrix elements at a computational cost that scales linearly with system size. For zero-temperature metals, the stochastic error scales like S−(d+2)/2d, where d is the dimension and S is a prefactor to the computational cost. The convergence becomes exponential if the system is at finite temperature or is insulating.","Comment to: “Martini straight: Boosting performance using a shorter cutoff and GPUs” by D.H. de Jong, S.

In a recent study published in this journal, de Jong et al. investigated the efficiency improvement reached thanks to new parameter sets for molecular dynamics simulations using the coarse-grained Martini force-field and its implementation in the Gromacs simulation package (de Jong et al., 2016). The advantages of the new sets are the computational efficiency and the conservation of the equilibrium properties of the Martini model. This article reports additional tests on the total energy conservation for zwitterionic lipid bilayer membranes. The results show that the conclusion by de Jong et al. on the total energy conservation of the new parameter sets, based on short simulations and homogeneous systems, is not generalizable to long lipid bilayer simulations. The energy conservation of the three parameter sets compared in their article (common, new and new-RF) differ if one analyzes sufficiently long trajectories or if one measures the total energy drifts. In practice, when total energy conservation is important for a Martini lipid bilayer simulation, we would consider either keeping the common set, or carefully testing the new-RF set for energy leaks or sources before production use.","(1) Gumbart, J.

One of the conclusions of the celebrated Saffman-Debr\""uck (SD) theory is that lipid disturbances smaller than the Saffman length (microns) are not affected by the hydrodynamics of the embedding solvent. Using molecular dynamics and coarse-grained models with implicit hydrodynamics we show that this is not true. Hydrodynamic interactions between the membrane and the solvent strongly enhance the short-time collective diffusion of lipids at all scales. The momentum transferred between the membrane and the solvent in normal direction (not considered by the SD theory) propagates tangentially over the membrane inducing long-ranged repulsive forces amongst lipids. As a consequence the lipid collective diffusion coefficient increases proportionally to the disturbance wavelength. We find quantitative agreement with the predicted anomalous diffusion in quasi-two-dimensional dynamics, observed in colloids confined to a plane but embedded in 3D solvent."
"Gaussian curvature directs the distribution of spontaneous curvature on bilayer membrane necks. Morgan Chabanon and Padmini Rangamani. Soft Matter. 2018. Accepted Manuscript. DOI: 10.1039/C8SM00035B
Formation of membrane necks is crucial for fission and fusion in lipid bilayers. In this work, we seek to answer the following fundamental question: what is the relationship between protein-induced spontaneous mean curvature and the Gaussian curvature at a membrane neck? Using an augmented Helfrich model for lipid bilayers to include membrane-protein interaction, we solve the shape equation on catenoids to find the field of spontaneous curvature that satisfies mechanical equilibrium of membrane necks. In this case, the shape equation reduces to a variable coefficient Helmholtz equation for spontaneous curvature, where the source term is proportional to the Gaussian curvature. We show how this latter quantity is responsible for non-uniform distribution of spontaneous curvature in minimal surfaces. We then explore the energetics of catenoids with different spontaneous curvature boundary conditions and geometric asymmetries to show how heterogeneities in spontaneous curvature distribution can couple with Gaussian curvature to result in membrane necks of different geometries.",,"Communication between the leaflets of asymmetric membranes revealed from coarse-grain molecular dynamics simulations

The inherent conflict between noncovalent interactions and the large conforma- tional entropy of the polypeptide chain forces folding reactions and their mechanisms to deviate significantly from chemical reactions. Accordingly, measures of structure in the transition state ensemble (TSE) are strongly influenced by the underlying distributions of microscopic folding pathways that are challenging to discern experimentally. Here, we present a detailed analysis of 150,000 folding transition paths of five proteins at three different thermodynamic conditions from an experimentally consistent statistical mechanical model. We find that the underlying TSE structural distributions are rarely unimodal, and the average experimental measures arise from complex underlying distributions. Unfolding pathways also exhibit subtle differences from folding counterparts due to a combination of Hammond behavior and native-state movements. Local interactions and topological complexity, to a lesser extent, are found to determine pathway heterogeneity, underscoring the importance of the balance between local and nonlocal energetics in protein folding."

Reaction Coordinate, Free Energy and Rate of Intramolecular Proton Transfer in Human Carbonic Anhydrase II
Sanjib Paul, Tanmoy Kumar Paul, and Srabani Taraphder
The Journal of Physical Chemistry B Just Accepted Manuscript
DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b10713
The role of structure and dynamics of an enzyme has been investigated at three different stages of its function including the chemical event it catalyzes. A one-pot computational method has been designed for each of these stages based on classical and/or QM-MM molecular dynamics and transition path sampling simulations. For a pair of initial and final states A and B separated by a high free energy barrier, using a two-stage selection process, several collective variables (CVs) are identified that can delineate A and B. However, these CVs are found to exhibit strong cross-coupling over the transition paths. A set of mutually orthogonal order parameters is then derived from these CVs and an optimal reaction coordinate, r determined applying half trajectory likelihood maximization along with a Bayesian information criterion. The transition paths are also used to project the multi-dimensional free energy surface and barrier crossing dynamics along r. The proposed scheme has been applied to the rate determining intramolecular proton transfer reaction of the well known enzyme human carbonic anhydrase II (HCA II). The potential-of-mean force, F(r) in the absence of the chemical step is found to reproduce earlier results on the equilibrium population of two sidechain orientations of the key residue His-64. Estimation of rate constants, k from mean first passage times for the three different stages of catalysis shows that the rate determining step of intramolecular proton transfer occurs with k ≃ 1.0 X 10 6 sec−1, in close agreement with known experimental results.","Heat transport in oscillator chains with long-range interactions coupled to thermal reservoirs

Phys. Rev. E 97, 032102

We investigate thermal conduction in arrays of long-range interacting rotors and Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU) oscillators coupled to two reservoirs at different temperatures. The strength of the interaction between two lattice sites decays as a power α of the inverse of their distance. We point out the necessity of distinguishing between energy flows towards or from the reservoirsand those within the system. We show that energy flow between the reservoirs occurs via a direct transfer induced by long-range couplings and a diffusive process through the chain. To this aim, we introduce a decomposition of the steady-state heat current that explicitly accounts for such direct transfer of energy between the reservoir. For 0≤α<1, the direct transfer term dominates, meaning that the system can be effectively described as a set of oscillators each interacting with the thermal baths. Also, the heat current exchanged with the reservoirs depends on the size of the thermalized regions: In the case in which such size is proportional to the system size N, the stationary current is independent on N. For α>1, heat transport mostly occurs through diffusion along the chain: For the rotors transport is normal, while for FPU the data are compatible with an anomalous diffusion, possibly with an α-dependent characteristic exponent.","Random heteropolymers preserve protein function in foreign environments

The successful incorporation of active proteins into synthetic polymers could lead to a new class of materials with functions found only in living systems. However, proteins rarely function under the conditions suitable for polymer processing. On the basis of an analysis of trends in protein sequences and characteristic chemical patterns on protein surfaces, we designed four-monomer random heteropolymers to mimic intrinsically disordered proteins for protein solubilization and stabilization in non-native environments. The heteropolymers, with optimized composition and statistical monomer distribution, enable cell-free synthesis of membrane proteins with proper protein folding for transport and enzyme-containing plastics for toxin bioremediation. Controlling the statistical monomer distribution in a heteropolymer, rather than the specific monomer sequence, affords a new strategy to interface with biological systems for protein-based biomaterials.

The formation and closure of aqueous pores in lipid bilayers is a key step in various biophysical processes. Large pores are well described by classical nucleation theory, but the free-energy landscape of small, biologically relevant pores has remained largely unexplored. The existence of small and metastable “prepores” was hypothesized decades ago from electroporation experiments, but resolving metastable prepores from theoretical models remained challenging. Using two complementary methods—atomistic simulations and self-consistent field theory of a minimal lipid model—we determine the parameters for which metastable prepores occur in lipid membranes. Both methods consistently suggest that pore metastability depends on the relative volume ratio between the lipid head group and lipid tails: lipids with a larger head-group volume fraction (or shorter saturated tails) form metastable prepores, whereas lipids with a smaller head-group volume fraction (or longer unsaturated tails) form unstable prepores."

Equipartition terms in transition path ensemble: Insights from molecular dynamics simulations of alanine dipeptide

Transition path ensemble consists of reactive trajectories and possesses all the information necessary for the understanding of the mechanism and dynamics of important condensed phase processes. However, quantitative description of the properties of the transition path ensemble is far from being established. Here, with numerical calculations on a model system, the equipartition terms defined in thermal equilibrium were for the first time estimated in the transition path ensemble. It was not surprising to observe that the energy was not equally distributed among all the coordinates. However, the energies distributed on a pair of conjugated coordinates remained equal. Higher energies were observed to be distributed on several coordinates, which are highly coupled to the reaction coordinate, while the rest were almost equally distributed. In addition, the ensemble-averaged energy on each coordinate as a function of time was also quantified. These quantitative analyses on energy distributions provided new insights into the transition path ensemble.","(1) Snead, W.; Zeno, W.; Kago, G.; Perkins, R.; Richter, J.

An accurate depiction of electrostatic interactions in molecular dynamics requires the correct number of ions in the simulation box to capture screening effects. However, the number of ions that should be added to the box is seldom given by the bulk salt concentration because a charged biomolecule solute will perturb the local solvent environment. We present a simple method for calculating the number of ions that requires only the total solute charge, solvent volume, and bulk salt concentration as inputs. We show that the most commonly used method for adding salt to a simulation results in an effective salt concentration that is too high. These findings are confirmed using simulations of lysozyme. We have established a web server where these calculations can be readily performed to aid simulation setup.

Neural network model chemistries (NNMCs) promise to facilitate the accurate exploration of chemical space and simulation of large reactive systems. One important path to improving these models is to add layers of physical detail, especially long-range forces. At short range, however, these models are data driven and data limited. Little is systematically known about how data should be sampled, and “test data” chosen randomly from some sampling techniques can provide poor information about generality. If the sampling method is narrow, “test error” can appear encouragingly tiny while the model fails catastrophically elsewhere. In this manuscript, we competitively evaluate two common sampling methods: molecular dynamics (MD), normal-mode sampling, and one uncommon alternative, Metadynamics (MetaMD), for preparing training geometries. We show that MD is an inefficient sampling method in the sense that additional samples do not improve generality. We also show that MetaMD is easily implemented in any NNMC software package with cost that scales linearly with the number of atoms in a sample molecule. MetaMD is a black-box way to ensure samples always reach out to new regions of chemical space, while remaining relevant to chemistry near kbT. It is a cheap tool to address the issue of generalization.","Bias-Exchange Metadynamics Simulation of Membrane Permeation of 20 Amino Acids

Thermodynamics of the permeation of amino acids from water to lipid bilayers is an important first step for understanding the mechanism of cell-permeating peptides and the thermodynamics of membrane protein structure and stability. In this work, we employed bias-exchange metadynamics simulations to simulate the membrane permeation of all 20 amino acids from water to the center of a dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) membrane (consists of 256 lipids) by using both directional and torsion angles for conformational sampling. The overall accuracy for the free energy profiles obtained is supported by significant correlation coefficients (correlation coefficient at 0.5-0.6) between our results and previous experimental or computational studies. The free energy profiles indicated that (1) polar amino acids have larger free energy barriers than nonpolar amino acids; (2) negatively charged amino acids are the most difficult to enter into the membrane; and (3) conformational transitions for many amino acids during membrane crossing is the key for reduced free energy barriers. These results represent the first set of simulated free energy profiles of membrane crossing for all 20 amino acids.

"Assessing Interactions Between a Polytopic Membrane Protein and Lipid Bilayers Using Differential Scanning Calorimetry and Solid-State NMR

It is known that the lipid composition within a cellular membrane can influence membrane protein structure and function. In this Article, we investigated how structural changes to a membrane protein upon substrate binding can impact the lipid bilayer. To carry out this study, we reconstituted the secondary active drug transporter EmrE into a variety of phospholipid bilayers varying in headgroup and chain length and carried out differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and solid-state NMR experiments. The DSC results revealed a difference in cooperativity of the lipid phase transition for drug-free EmrE protonated at glutamic acid 14 (i.e., proton-loaded form) and the tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP+) bound form of the protein (i.e., drug-loaded form). To complement these findings, we acquired magic-angle-spinning (MAS) spectra in the presence and absence of TPP+ by directly probing the phospholipid headgroup using 31P NMR. These spectra showed a reduction in lipid line widths around the main phase transition for samples where EmrE was bound to TPP+ compared to the drug free form. Finally, we collected oriented solid-state NMR spectra on isotopically enriched EmrE that displayed chemical shift perturbations to both transmembrane and loop residues upon TPP+ binding. All of these results prompt us to propose a mechanism whereby substrate-induced changes to the structural dynamics of EmrE alters the surrounding lipids within the bilayer.","(1) Masone, D.; Uhart, M.; Bustos, D.

Over recent decades, lipid membranes have become standard models for examining the biophysics and biochemistry of cell membranes. Interrogation of lipid domains within biomembranes is generally done with fluorescence microscopy via exogenous chemical probes. However, fluorophores have limited partitioning tunability, with the majority segregating into the liquid-disordered phase, and fluorescence only strictly reports on the small percentage of tagged lipids. We present simple, label-free imaging of domain formation in lipid monolayers, with chemical selectivity in unraveling lipid and cholesterol composition in different domain types. Exploiting conventional vibrational contrast in spontaneous Raman imaging, combined with chemometrics analysis, allows for examination of ternary systems containing saturated lipids, unsaturated lipids, and cholesterol. We confirm features commonly observed by fluorescence microscopy and provide a quantitative thermodynamic analysis of cholesterol distribution at the single-monolayer level.

Understanding the (de)mixing behavior of multicomponent lipid bilayers is an important step toward unraveling the nature of spatial composition heterogeneities in cellular membranes and their role in biological function. We use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to study the composition phase diagram of a quaternary mixture of phospholipids and cholesterol. This mixture is known to exhibit both uniform and coexisting phases. We compare and combine different statistical measures of membrane structure to identify the onset of phase coexistence in composition space. An important element in our approach is the dependence of composition heterogeneities on the size of the system. While homogeneous phases can be structured and display long correlation lengths, the hallmark behavior of phase coexistence is the scaling of the apparent correlation length with system size. Because the latter cannot be easily varied in simulations, our method instead uses information obtained from observation windows of different sizes to accurately distinguish phase coexistence from structured homogeneous phases. This approach is built on very general physical principles, and will be beneficial to future studies of the phase behavior of multicomponent lipid bilayers.","The key role of electrostatic interactions in the induced folding in RNA recognition by DCL1-A

The intrinsically disordered protein domain DCL1-A is the first report of a complete double stranded RNA binding domain folding upon binding. DCL1-A recognizes the dsRNA by acquiring a well-folded structure after engagement with its interaction partner. Despite the structural characterization of the interaction complex underlying the recognition of dsRNA has been established, the dynamics of disorder-to-order transitions in the binding process remains elusive. Here we have developed a coarse-grained structure-based model with consideration of electrostatic interactions to explore the mechanism of the coupled folding and binding. Our approach led to remarkable agreements with both experimental and theoretical results. We quantified the global binding-folding landscape, which indicates a synergistic binding induced folding mechanism. We further investigated the effect of electrostatic interactions in this coupled folding and binding process. It reveals that non-native electrostatic interactions dominate the initial stage of the recognition. Our results help improve our understanding of the induced folding of the IDP DCL1-A upon binding to dsRNA. Such methods developed here can be applied for further explorations of the dynamics of coupled folding and binding systems.

During the lifecycle of many enveloped viruses, a nucleocapsid core buds through the cell membrane to acquire an outer envelope of lipid membrane and viral glycoproteins. However, the presence of a nucleocapsid core is not required for assembly of infectious particles. To determine the role of the nucleocapsid core, we develop a coarse-grained computational model with which we investigate budding dynamics as a function of glycoprotein and nucleocapsid interactions, as well as budding in the absence of a nucleocapsid. We find that there is a transition between glycoprotein-directed budding and nucleocapsid-directed budding that oc-curs above a threshold strength of nucleocapsid interactions. The simulations predict that glycoprotein-directed budding leads to significantly increased size polydispersity and particle polymorphism. This polydispersity can be explained by a theoretical model accounting for the competition between bending energy of the membrane and the glycoprotein shell. The simulations also show that the geometry of a budding particle leads to a barrier to subunit diffusion, which can result in a stalled, partially budded state. We present a phase diagram for this and other morphologies of budded particles. Comparison of these structures against experi-ments could establish bounds on whether budding is directed by glycoprotein or nucleocapsid interactions. Although our model is motivated by alphaviruses, we discuss implications of our results for other enveloped viruses.","(1) Ahmed, M. C.; Papaleo, E.; Lindorff-Larsen, K.

The ESCRTs catalyze reverse-topology scission from the inner face of membrane necks in HIV budding, multivesicular endosome biogenesis, cytokinesis, and other pathways. We encapsulated a minimal ESCRT module consisting of ESCRT-III subunits Snf7, Vps24, and Vps2, and the AAA+ ATPase Vps4 such that membrane nanotubes reflecting the correct topology of scission could be pulled from giant vesicles. Upon ATP release by photo-uncaging, this system was capable of generating forces within the nanotubes in a manner dependent upon Vps4 catalytic activity, Vps4 coupling to the ESCRT-III proteins, and membrane insertion by Snf7. At physiological concentrations, single scission events were observed that correlated with forces of ~6 pN, verifying predictions that ESCRTs are capable of exerting forces on membranes. Imaging of scission with subsecond resolution revealed Snf7 puncta at the sites of membrane cutting, directly verifying longstanding predictions for the ESCRT scission mechanism.","Actin filaments growing against an elastic membrane: Effect of membrane tension

Volume 97, 032408 (2018) DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevE.97.032408

We study the force generation by a set of parallel actin filaments growing against an elastic membrane. The elastic membrane tries to stay flat and any deformation from this flat state, either caused by thermal fluctuations or due to protrusive polymerization force exerted by the filaments, costs energy. We study two lattice models to describe the membrane dynamics. In one case, the energy cost is assumed to be proportional to the absolute magnitude of the height gradient (gradient model) and in the other case it is proportional to the square of the height gradient (Gaussian model). For the gradient model we find that the membrane velocity is a nonmonotonic function of the elastic constant μ and reaches a peak at μ=μ∗. For μ<μ∗ the system fails to reach a steady state and the membrane energy keeps increasing with time. For the Gaussian model, the system always reaches a steady state and the membrane velocity decreases monotonically with the elastic constant ν for all nonzero values of ν. Multiple filaments give rise to protrusions at different regions of the membrane and the elasticity of the membrane induces an effective attraction between the two protrusions in the Gaussian model which causes the protrusions to merge and a single wide protrusion is present in the system. In both the models, the relative time scale between the membrane and filament dynamics plays an important role in deciding whether the shape of elasticity–velocity curve is concave or convex. Our numerical simulations agree reasonably well with our analytical calculations.","Protein homology model refinement by large-scale energy optimization

Proteins fold to their lowest free-energy structures, and hence the most straightforward way to increase the accuracy of a partially incorrect protein structure model is to search for the lowest-energy nearby structure. This direct approach has met with little success for two reasons: first, energy function inaccuracies can lead to false energy minima, resulting in model degradation rather than improvement; and second, even with an accurate energy function, the search problem is formidable because the energy only drops considerably in the immediate vicinity of the global minimum, and there are a very large number of degrees of freedom. Here we describe a large-scale energy optimization-based refinement method that incorporates advances in both search and energy function accuracy that can substantially improve the accuracy of low-resolution homology models. The method refined low-resolution homology models into correct folds for 50 of 84 diverse protein families and generated improved models in recent blind structure prediction experiments. Analyses of the basis for these improvements reveal contributions from both the improvements in conformational sampling techniques and the energy function.

We measured the effect of intrinsic lipid curvature, J0, on structural properties of asymmetric vesicles made of palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE; J0<0) and palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (POPC; J0∼0). Electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering were used to determine vesicle size and morphology, and x-ray and neutron scattering, combined with calorimetric experiments and solution NMR, yielded insights into leaflet-specific lipid packing and melting processes. Below the lipid melting temperature we observed strong interleaflet coupling in asymmetric vesicles with POPE inner bilayer leaflets and outer leaflets enriched in POPC. This lipid arrangement manifested itself by lipids melting cooperatively in both leaflets, and a rearrangement of lipid packing in both monolayers. On the other hand, no coupling was observed in vesicles with POPC inner bilayer leaflets and outer leaflets enriched in POPE. In this case, the leaflets melted independently and did not affect each other's acyl chain packing. Furthermore, we found no evidence for transbilayer structural coupling above the melting temperature of either sample preparation. Our results are consistent with the energetically preferred location of POPE residing in the inner leaflet, where it also resides in natural membranes, most likely causing the coupling of both leaflets. The loss of this coupling in the fluid bilayers is most likely the result of entropic contributions.","(1) Dawid, A. E.; Gront, D.; Kolinski, A.

Maximum-entropy ensembles are key primitives in statistical mechanics from which thermodynamic properties can be derived. Over the decades, several approaches have been put forward in order to justify from minimal assumptions the use of these ensembles in statistical descriptions. However, there is still no full consensus on the precise reasoning justifying the use of such ensembles. In this work, we provide a new approach to derive maximum-entropy ensembles taking a strictly operational perspective. We investigate the set of possible transitions that a system can undergo together with an environment, when one only has partial information about both the system and its environment. The set of all these allowed transitions encodes thermodynamic laws and limitations on thermodynamic tasks as particular cases. Our main result is that the set of allowed transitions coincides with the one possible if both system and environment were assigned the maximum entropy state compatible with the partial information. This justifies the overwhelming success of such ensembles and provides a derivation without relying on considerations of typicality or information-theoretic measures."," Title: Generating Converged Accurate Free Energy Surfaces for Chemical Reactions with a Force-Matched Semiempirical Model

Abstract: We demonstrate the capability of creating robust density functional tight binding (DFTB) models for chemical reactivity in prebiotic mixtures through force matching to short time scale quantum free energy estimates. Molecular dynamics using density functional theory (DFT) is a highly accurate approach to generate free energy surfaces for chemical reactions, but the extreme computational cost often limits the time scales and range of thermodynamic states that can feasibly be studied. In contrast, DFTB is a semiempirical quantum method that affords up to a thousandfold reduction in cost and can recover DFT-level accuracy. Here, we show that a force-matched DFTB model for aqueous glycine condensation reactions yields free energy surfaces that are consistent with experimental observations of reaction energetics. Convergence analysis reveals that multiple nanoseconds of combined trajectory are needed to reach a steady-fluctuating free energy estimate for glycine condensation. Predictive accuracy of force-matched DFTB is demonstrated by direct comparison to DFT, with the two approaches yielding surfaces with large regions that differ by only a few kcal mol–1.","The Effects of the Interplay Between Motor and Brownian Forces on the Rheology of Active Gels, Journal of Physical Chemistry B, 26 March, 2018 (Web), DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b00238, Active gels perform key mechanical roles inside the cell, such as cell division, motion and force sensing. The unique mechanical properties required to perform such functions arise from the interactions between molecular motors and semi-flexible polymeric filaments. Molecular motors can convert the energy released in the hydrolysis of ATP into forces of up to picoNewton magnitudes. Moreover, the polymeric filaments that form active gels are flexible enough to respond to Brownian forces, but also stiff enough to support the large tensions induced by the motor-generated forces. Brownian forces are expected to have a significant effect especially at motor activities at which stable non-contractile in vitro active gels are prepared for rheological measurements. Here, a microscopic mean-field theory of active gels originally formulated in the limit of motor-dominated dynamics is extended to include Brownian forces. In the model presented here Brownian forces are included accurately, at real room temperature, even in systems with high motor activity. It is shown that a subtle interplay, or competition, between motor-generated forces and Brownian forces has an important impact in the mass transport and rheological properties of active gels. The model predictions show that at low frequencies the dynamic modulus of active gels is determined mostly by motor protein dynamics. However, Brownian forces significantly increase the breadth of the relaxation spectrum and can affect the shape of the dynamic modulus over a wide frequency range even for ratios of motor to Brownian forces of more than a hundred. Since the ratio between motor and Brownian forces is sensitive to ATP concentration, the results presented here shed some light on how the transient mechanical response of active gels changes with varying ATP concentration."
"DeePCG: constructing coarse-grained models via deep neural networks 
Linfeng Zhang, Jiequn Han, Han Wang, Roberto Car, E. Weinan 
arXiv:1802.08549v1 [physics.chem-ph] (2018) 
We introduce a general framework for constructing coarse-grained potential models without ad hoc approximations such as limiting the potential to two- and/or three-body contributions. The scheme, called Deep Coarse-Grained Potential (abbreviated DeePCG), exploits a carefully crafted neural network to construct a many-body coarse-grained potential. The network is trained with full atomistic data in a way that preserves the natural symmetries of the system. The resulting model is very accurate and can be used to sample the configurations of the coarse-grained variables in a much faster way than with the original atomistic model. As an application we consider liquid water and use the oxygen coordinates as the coarse-grained variables, starting from a full atomistic simulation of this system at the ab-initio molecular dynamics level. We found that the two-body, three-body and higher order oxygen correlation functions produced by the coarse-grained and full atomistic models agree very well with each other, illustrating the effectiveness of the DeePCG model on a rather challenging task.

This ensures smooth and accurate Hessian surfaces, which are required for rate constant calculations using instanton theory. Our aim was a local, accurate fit rather than a global PES because instanton theory requires information on the potential only in the close vicinity of the main tunneling path. Elongations along vibrational normal modes at the transition state are used as coordinates for the neural network. The method is applied to the hydrogen abstraction reaction from methanol, calculated on a coupled-cluster level of theory. The reaction is essential in astrochemistry to explain the deuteration of methanol in the interstellar medium.

A key quantity to characterize diffusion is the particle lifetime, which is the time taken for a diffusing particle to exit by hitting an absorbing boundary. Calculating the particle lifetime provides valuable information, for example, by allowing us to compare the timescale of diffusion and the timescale of the reaction, thereby helping us to develop appropriate mathematical models. Previous methods to quantify particle lifetimes focus on the mean particle lifetime. Here, we take a different approach and present a simple method for calculating the maximum particle lifetime. This is the time after which only a small specified proportion of particles in an ensemble remain in the system. Our approach produces accurate estimates of the maximum particle lifetime, whereas the mean particle lifetime always underestimates this value compared with data from stochastic simulations. Furthermore, we find that differences between the mean and maximum particle lifetimes become increasingly important when considering diffusion hindered by obstacles."
"Free Energy Calculations of Membrane Permeation: Challenges Due to Strong Headgroup−Solute Interactions

J. Chem. Theory Comput, Accepted Manuscript (2018) doi: 10.1021/acs.jctc.7b01159 
Understanding how different classes of molecules move across biological membranes is a prerequisite to predicting a solute’s permeation rate, which is a critical factor in the fields of drug design and pharmacology. We use biased molecular dynamics computer simulations to calculate and compare the free energy profiles of translocation of several small molecules across 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) lipid bilayers as a first step toward determining the most efficient method for free energy calculations. We study the translocation of arginine, a sodium ion, alanine, and a single water molecule using the metadynamics, umbrella sampling, and replica exchange umbrella sampling techniques. Within the fixed lengths of our simulations, we find that all methods produce similar results for charge-neutral permeants, but not for polar or positively charged molecules. We identify the long relaxation time scale of electrostatic interactions between lipid headgroups and the solute to be the principal cause of this difference and show that this slow process can lead to an erroneous dependence of computed free energy profiles on the initial system configuration. We demonstrate the use of committor analysis to validate the proper sampling of the presumed transition state, which in our simulations is achieved only in replica exchange calculations. On the basis of these results we provide some useful guidance to perform and evaluate free energy calculations of membrane permeation.
","Role of translational entropy in spatially inhomogeneous, coarse-grained models
Marcel Langenberg1, Nicholas E. Jackson2,3, Juan J. de Pablo2,3, and Marcus Müller1,a)
The Journal of Chemical Physics 2018 148:9

Coarse-grained models of polymer and biomolecular systems have enabled the computational study of cooperative phenomena, e.g., self-assembly, by lumping multiple atomistic degrees of freedom along the backbone of a polymer, lipid, or DNA molecule into one effective coarse-grained interaction center. Such a coarse-graining strategy leaves the number of molecules unaltered. In order to treat the surrounding solvent or counterions on the same coarse-grained level of description, one can also stochastically group several of those small molecules into an effective, coarse-grained solvent bead or “fluid element.” Such a procedure reduces the number of molecules, and we discuss how to compensate the concomitant loss of translational entropy by density-dependent interactions in spatially inhomogeneous systems.

Most biological molecules contain acido-basic groups that modulate their structure and interactions. A consequence is that pH gradients, local heterogeneities and dynamic variations are used by cells and organisms to drive or regulate specific biological functions including energetic metabolism, vesicular traffic, migration and spatial patterning of tissues in development. While the direct or regulatory role of pH in protein function is well documented, the role of hydrogen and hydroxyl ions in modulating the properties of lipid assemblies such as bilayer membranes is only beginning to be understood. Here, we review approaches using artificial lipid vesicles that have been instrumental in providing an understanding of the influence of pH gradients and local variations on membrane vectorial motional processes: migration, membrane curvature effects promoting global or local deformations, crowding generation by segregative polarization processes. In the case of pH induced local deformations, an extensive theoretical framework is given and an application to a specific biological issue, namely the structure and stability of mitochondrial cristae, is described.

","Chemical event chain model of coupled genetic oscillators

David J. Jörg, Luis G. Morelli, and Frank Jülicher
Phys. Rev. E 97, 032409 – Published 19 March 2018

We introduce a stochastic model of coupled genetic oscillators in which chains of chemical events involved in gene regulation and expression are represented as sequences of Poisson processes. We characterize steady states by their frequency, their quality factor, and their synchrony by the oscillator cross correlation. The steady state is determined by coupling and exhibits stochastic transitions between different modes. The interplay of stochasticity and nonlinearity leads to isolated regions in parameter space in which the coupled system works best as a biological pacemaker. Key features of the stochastic oscillations can be captured by an effective model for phase oscillators that are coupled by signals with distributed delays.","Frequency adaptive metadynamics for the calculation of rare-event kinetics, 13 February, 2018, arXiv:1802.04182, The ability to predict accurate thermodynamic and kinetic properties in biomolecular systems is of both scientific and practical utility. While both remain very difficult, predictions of kinetics are particularly difficult because rates, in contrast to free energies, depend on the route taken and are thus not amenable to all enhanced sampling methods. It has recently been demonstrated that it is possible to recover kinetics through so called ‘infrequent metadynamics’ simulations, where the simulations are biased in a way that minimally corrupts the dynamics of moving between metastable states. This method, however, requires the bias to be added slowly, thus hampering applications to processes with only modest separations of timescales. Here we present a frequency-adaptive strategy which bridges normal and infrequent metadynamics. We show that this strategy can improve the precision and accuracy of rate calculations at fixed computational cost, and should be able to extend rate calculations for much slower kinetic processes."

DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.7b01210
Abstract:
The implementation, validation and application of the Multi-State VALBOND (MS-VALBOND) method for transition metal-containing and hypervalent molecules is presented. This approach is particularly suited for molecules with unusual shapes and systems that need to be described by a superposition of resonance structures, each of which satisfies the octet rule. The implementation is based on the original VALBOND force field and allows to smoothly switch between resonance structures, each of which can be characterized by its own force field, including varying charge distributions, and coupling terms between the states. The implementation conserves total energy for simulations in the gas phase and in solution and is applied to a number of topical systems. For the small hypervalent molecule ClF$_3$ the barrier for pseudorotation is found to be 4.3 kcal/mol which compares favourable with the experimentally measured value of 4.8 kcal/mol. A transition metal-containing complex is cisplatin, characterized by 6 resonance states, for which the vibrational spectrum is found to be in good agreement with experiment. Finally, umbrella sampling simulations of the S$_{\rm N}$2 reaction $\rm BrMe + Cl^- \rightarrow Br^- + MeCl$ in solution yields a barrier height of 24.6 kcal/mol, in good agreement with experiment (24.7 kcal/mol).

The ReaxFF protein reactive force field (protein-2013) has been successfully employed to simulate the biomolecules and membrane fuel cells, but it inaccurately describes the weak interaction of functionalized hydrocarbon/water molecules in condensed phase, especially for the density. In this article, the development of a ReaxFF force field (CHON-2017_weak) on the basis of protein-2013 is presented that improves the weak interaction description between carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen. To examine the quality of the force field, we performed a series of molecular dynamics simulations with model systems. These simulations, describing density trends for pure and mixture compound systems, demonstrate that CHON-2017_weak force field predictions are in good agreement with experimental data. Furthermore, ReaxFF can also describe the phase separation in hexane-water mixture and dissolution of ethanol or tetramethylammonium (TMA) in liquid water. To validate it in the application of membrane fuel cells, we studied structural property and degradation mechanism of TMA in alkaline aqueous solution, as well as some typical chemical reactions for small compounds. On the basis of our results, an additional reaction pathway is proposed for the degradation of TMA, which seems to be more energetically favorable compared to the main mechanism predicted from quantum mechanics calculations.","Transferable neural networks for enhanced sampling of protein dynamics.

Variational auto-encoder frameworks have demonstrated success in reducing complex nonlinear dynamics in molecular simulation to a single non-linear embedding. In this work, we illustrate how this non-linear latent embedding can be used as a collective variable for enhanced sampling, and present a simple modification that allows us to rapidly perform sampling in multiple related systems. We first demonstrate our method is able to describe the effects of force field changes in capped alanine dipeptide after learning a model using AMBER99. We further provide a simple extension to variational dynamics encoders that allows the model to be trained in a more efficient manner on larger systems by encoding the outputs of a linear transformation using time-structure based independent component analysis (tICA). Using this technique, we show how such a model trained for one protein, the WW domain, can efficiently be transferred to perform enhanced sampling on a related mutant protein, the GTT mutation. This method shows promise for its ability to rapidly sample related systems using a single transferable collective variable, enabling us to probe the effects of variation in increasingly large systems of biophysical interest.","A four-site molecular model for simulations of liquid methanol and water-methanol mixtures: MeOH-4P

Manuel Martínez-Jiménez and Humberto Saint-Martin Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation Just Accepted Manuscript DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.7b01265

In this work we present a new four-site potential for methanol, MeOH-4P, fitted to reproduce the dielectric constant ε, the surface tension γs and the liquid density ρ of the pure liquid, at T = 298.15 K and p = 1 bar. The partial charges on each site were taken from the OPLS/2016 model with the only difference of putting the negative charge on the fourth site (M) instead of on the O atom, as done in four-site water models. The original Lennard-Jones (LJ) parameters of OPLS/2016 for the methyl moiety (Me) were modified for the fitting of ρ and γs whereas the parameters of the TIP4P-FB water model were used for the O atom without change. Taking into account the energetic cost of the enhanced dipole relative to the isolated molecule, the results from simulations with this model showed good agreement with experiment for ρ, αp, κT, Cp, ∆Hv−l; while the temperature-dependence of γs and ε is satisfactory in the interval between 260 K and 360 K and the critical-point description is similar to that of OPLS/2016. It is shown that orientational correlations, described by the Kirkwood factor Gk, play a prominent role in the appropriate description of dielectric constant in existing models; unfortunately, the enhancement of the dipole moment produced a low diffusion coefficient DMeOH, thus a compromise was required between a good reproduction of ε and an acceptable DMeOH. The use of a fourth site resulted in a significant improvement for water-methanol mixtures described with TIP4P-FB and MeOH-4P, respectively, but required non-standard LJ combination rules that allowed a good description of the methanol molar-fraction dependence of ρ, ε, water (methanol) diffusion coefficients DMeOH (DH2O) and excess volume of mixing ∆Vmix, in the entire range of composition. The resulting free energy of hydration ∆Ghyd shows excellent agreement with experiment in the interval between 280 K and 360 K.","Rheology of Membrane-Attached Minimal Actin Cortices.

The actin cortex is a thin cross-linked network attached to the plasma membrane, being responsible for the cell's shape during migration, division and growth. In a reductionist approach, we created a minimal actin cortex (MAC) attached to a lipid membrane to correlate the filamentous actin architecture with its viscoelastic properties. The system is composed of a supported 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) bilayer doped with the receptor lipid phosphatidylinositol(4,5)-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) to which a constitutively active mutant of ezrin, being a direct membrane-cytoskeleton linker, is bound. The formation of the MAC on the supported lipid bilayer is analyzed as a function of increasing PtdIns(4,5)P2/ezrin pinning points revealing an increase in the intersections between actin filaments, i.e., the node density of the MAC. Bead tracking microrheology on the membrane attached actin network provides information about its viscoelastic properties. The results show that ezrin serves as a dynamic cross-linker for the actin cortex attached to the lipid bilayer and that the stiffness of the network is influenced by the pinning point density, relating the plateau storage modulus G0 to the node density of the MAC.

Abstract:
Computational crystal-phase prediction means have become an important tool in materials science for the acceleration of material discovery. Material phases stabilized by substantial entropic effects, however, cannot be accounted for with today’s widely used methods. We propose a new search method for such phases in the framework of metadynamics using surrogates for entropy and enthalpy as collective variables. Applying the method to AgI at low pressure, the method is found to be effective in discovering the material’s entropically stabilized superionic phase as well as its enthalpically stabilized β phase. Through calculating the material’s free-energy surfaces at different temperatures, we additionally estimate the system’s melting temperature as well as the transition temperature between the β and superionic phases. The calculation of the free energy is accelerated by the use of a path collective variable defined in the space of our surrogates for entropy and enthalpy.

Abstract
We investigated the impact of hydrodynamic interactions (HI) on protein folding using a coarse-grained model. The extent of the impact of hydrodynamic interactions, whether it accelerates, retards, or has no effect on protein folding, has been controversial. Together with a theoretical framework of the energy landscape theory (ELT) for protein folding that describes the dynamics of the collective motion with a single reaction coordinate across a folding barrier, we compared the kinetic effects of HI on the folding rates of two protein models that use a chain of single beads with distinctive topologies: a 64-residue α / β chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2) protein, and a 57-residue β -barrel α -spectrin Src-homology 3 domain (SH3) protein. When comparing the protein folding kinetics simulated with Brownian dynamics in the presence of HI to that in the absence of HI, we find that the effect of HI on protein folding appears to have a “crossover” behavior about the folding temperature. This means that at a temperature greater than the folding temperature, the enhanced friction from the hydrodynamic solvents between the beads in an unfolded configuration results in lowered folding rate; conversely, at a temperature lower than the folding temperature, HI accelerates folding by the backflow of solvent toward the folded configuration of a protein. Additionally, the extent of acceleration depends on the topology of a protein: for a protein like CI2, where its folding nucleus is rather diffuse in a transition state, HI channels the formation of contacts by favoring a major folding pathway in a complex free energy landscape, thus accelerating folding. For a protein like SH3, where its folding nucleus is already specific and less diffuse, HI matters less at a temperature lower than the folding temperature. Our findings provide further theoretical insight to protein folding kinetic experiments and simulations.

Water is an essential in many biological processes, and the hydration structure plays a critical role in facilitating protein folding, dynamics and ligand binding. A variety of biophysical spectroscopic techniques have been used to probe the water solvating proteins, often complemented with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to resolve the spatial and dynamic features of the hydration shell, but comparing relative water structure is challenging. In this study 1 microsecond MD simulations were performed to identify and characterize hydration sites around HIV-1 protease bound to an inhibitor, darunavir (DRV). The water density, hydration site occupancy, extent and anisotropy of fluctuations, coordinated water molecules, and hydrogen bonds were characterized and compared to the properties of bulk water. The water density of the principal hydration shell was found to be higher than bulk, dependent on the topology and physio-chemical identity of the biomolecular surface. The dynamics of water molecules occupying principal hydration sites was highly dependent on the number of water-water interactions, and inversely correlated with hydrogen bonds to the protein-inhibitor complex. While many waters were conserved following the symmetry of homodimeric HIV protease, the asymmetry induced by DRV resulted in asymmetric lower-occupancy hydration sites at the concave surface of the active site. Key interactions between water molecules and the protease, that stabilize the protein in the inhibited form, were altered in a drug resistant variant of the protease indicating that modulation of solvent-solute interactions might play a key role in conveying drug resistance. Our analysis provides insights into the interplay between an enzyme inhibitor complex and the hydration shell and has implications in elucidating water structure in a variety of biological processes and applications including ligand binding, inhibitor design and resistance.","Frequency adaptive metadynamics for the calculation of rare-event kinetics, 13 February, 2018, arXiv:1802.04182, The ability to predict accurate thermodynamic and kinetic properties in biomolecular systems is of both scientific and practical utility.

For nanoparticle (NP)-based drug delivery platforms, the elasticity of the NPs has a significant influence on their blood circulation time and cellular uptake efficiency. However, due to the complexity of the endocytosis process and the inconsistency in the definition of elasticity for NPs in experiments, the understanding about the receptor-mediated endocytosis process of elastic NPs is still limited. In this work, we developed a coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) model for elastic NPs. The energy change of the elastic NPs can be precisely controlled by the bond, area, volume and bending potentials of this CGMD model. To represent liposomes with different elasticities, we systematically varied the bending rigidity of elastic NPs in CGMD simulations. Additionally, we changed the radius of the elastic NPs to explore the potential size effect. Through virtual nano-indentation tests, we found that the effective stiffness of elastic NPs was determined by their bending rigidity and size. Afterwards, we investigated the receptor-mediated endocytosis process of elastic NPs with different sizes and bending rigidities. We found that the membrane wrapping of soft NPs was faster than that of the stiff ones at the early stage, due to the NP deformation induced large contact area between the NPs and the membrane. However, because of the large energy penalties induced by the NP deformation, the membrane wrapping speed of soft NPs slows down during the late stage. Eventually, the soft NPs are wrapped less efficiently than the stiff ones during the membrane wrapping process. Through systematic CGMD simulations, we found a scaling law between the cellular uptake efficiency and the phenomenal bending rigidity of elastic NPs, which agrees reasonably well with experimental observations. Furthermore, we observed that the membrane wrapping efficiencies of soft and stiff NPs with large sizes were close to each other, due to the stronger ligand–receptor binding force and smaller difference in the stiffness of elastic NPs. Our computational model provides an effective tool to investigate the receptor-mediated endocytosis of elastic NPs with well controlled mechanical properties. This study can also be applied to guide the design of NP-based drug carriers with high efficacy, by utilizing their elastic properties.","3. Title: Path collective variables without paths

Abstract
We introduce a method to obtain one-dimensional collective variables for studying rarely occurring transitions between two metastable states separated by a high free energy barrier. No previous information, not even approximated, on the path followed during the transition is needed. The only requirement is to know the fluctuations of the system while in the two metastable states. With this information in hand we build the collective variable using a modified version of Fisher's linear discriminant analysis. The usefulness of this approach is tested on the metadynamics simulation of two representative systems. The first is the freezing of silver iodide into the superionic αα-phase, the second is the study of a classical Diels Alder reaction. The collective variable works very well in these two diverse cases.

Habeck, M. and Nguyen, T. (), A probabilistic network model for structural transitions in biomolecules. Proteins. Accepted Author Manuscript. doi:10.1002/prot.25490 

Biological macromolecules often undergo large conformational rearrangements during a functional cycle. To simulate these structural transitions with full atomic detail typically demands extensive computational resources. Moreover, it is unclear how to incorporate, in a principled way, additional experimental information that could guide the structural transition. This article develops a probabilistic model for conformational transitions in biomolecules. The model can be viewed as a network of anharmonic springs that break, if the experimental data support the rupture of bonds. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo in internal coordinates is used to infer structural transitions from experimental data, thereby sampling large conformational transitions without distorting the structure. The model is benchmarked on a large set of conformational transitions. Moreover we demonstrate the use of the probabilistic network model for integrative modeling of macromolecular complexes based on data from crosslinking followed by mass spectrometry.

An extension of the GROMOS 56a6CARBO/CARBO_R force field for hexopyranose-based carbohydrates is presented. The additional parameters describe the conformational properties of uronate residues. The three distinct chemical states of the carboxyl group are considered: deprotonated (negatively charged), protonated (neutral) and esterified (neutral). The parameterization procedure was based on quantum-chemical calculations and the resulting parameters were tested in the context of: (i) flexibility of the pyranose rings under different pH conditions; (ii) conformation of the glycosidic linkage of the (1→4)-type for uronates with different chemical states of carboxyl moieties; (iii) conformation of the exocyclic (i.e. carboxylate and lactol) moieties; (iv) structure of the Ca2+-linked chain-chain complexes of uronates. The presently proposed parameters in combination with the 56a6CARBO/CARBO_R set can be used to describe the naturally occurring polyuronates, composed either of homogeneous (e.g. glucuronans) or heterogeneous (e.g. pectins, alginates) segments. The results of simulations relying on the new set of parameters indicate that the conformation of glycosidic linkage is nearly unaffected by the chemical state of the carboxyl group, in contrary to the ring conformational equilibria. The calculations for the poly(a-D-galacturonate)-Ca2+ and poly(a-L-guluronate)-Ca2+ complexes show that both parallel and anitiparallel arrangements of uronate chains are possible but differ in several structural aspects.","

In the current paper, phospholipid bilayers are modeled using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations with the MARTINI force field. The extracted molecular trajectories are analyzed using Fourier analysis of the undulations and orientation vectors to establish the differences between the two approaches for evaluating the bending modulus. The current work evaluates and extends the implementation of the Fourier analysis for molecular trajectories using a weighted horizon-based averaging approach. The effect of numerical parameters in the analysis of these trajectories is explored by conducting parametric studies. Computational modeling results are validated against experimentally characterized bending modulus of lipid membranes using a shape fluctuation analysis. The computational framework is then used to estimate the bending moduli for different types of lipids (phosphocholine, phosphoethanolamine, and phosphoglycerol). This work provides greater insight into the numerical aspects of evaluating the bilayer bending modulus, provides validation for the orientation analysis technique, and explores differences in bending moduli based on differences in the lipid nanostructures."
"Assessing AMBER force fields for protein folding in an implicit solvent

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation implemented with a state-of-the-art protein force field and implicit solvent model is an attractive approach to investigate protein folding, one of the most perplexing problems in molecular biology. But how well can force fields developed independently of implicit solvent models work together in reproducing diverse protein native structures and measuring the corresponding folding thermodynamics is not always clear. In this work, we performed enhanced sampling MD simulations to assess the ability of six AMBER force fields (FF99SBildn, FF99SBnmr, FF12SB, FF14ipq, FF14SB, and FF14SBonlysc) as coupled with a recently improved pair-wise GB-Neck2 model in modeling the folding of two helical and two β-sheet peptides. Whilst most of the tested force fields can yield roughly similar features for equilibrium conformational ensembles and detailed folding free-energy profiles for short α-helical TC10b in an implicit solvent, the measured counterparts are significantly discrepant in the cases of larger or β-structured peptides (HP35, 1E0Q, and GTT). Additionally, the calculated folding/unfolding thermodynamic quantities can only partially match the experimental data. Although a combination of the force fields and GB-Neck2 implicit model able to describe all aspects of the folding transitions towards the native structures of all the considered peptides was not identified, we found that FF14SBonlysc coupled with the GB-Neck2 model seems to be a reasonably balanced combination to predict peptide folding preferences.

Abstract
Over the past decades, atomistic simulations of chemical, biological and materials systems have become increasingly precise and predictive thanks to the development of accurate and efficient techniques that describe the quantum mechanical behavior of electrons. However, the overwhelming majority of such simulations still assume that the nuclei behave as classical particles. While historically this approximation could sometimes be justified due to complexity and computational overhead, the lack of nuclear quantum effects has become one of the biggest sources of error when systems containing light atoms are treated using current state-of-the-art descriptions of chemical interactions. Over the past decade, this realization has spurred a series of methodological advances that have led to dramatic reductions in the cost of including these important physical effects in the structure and dynamics of chemical systems. Here we show how these developments are now allowing nuclear quantum effects to become a mainstream feature of molecular simulations. These advances have led to new insights into chemical processes in the condensed phase and open the door to many exciting future opportunities.

Interplay between membrane curvature and protein conformational equilibrium investigated by solid-state NMR, Journal of Structural Biology, 2018
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsb.2018.02.007.
Many membrane proteins sense and induce membrane curvature for function, but structural information about how proteins modulate their structures to cause membrane curvature is sparse. We review our recent solid-state NMR studies of two virus membrane proteins whose conformational equilibrium is tightly coupled to membrane curvature. The influenza M2 proton channel has a drug-binding site in the transmembrane (TM) pore. Previous chemical shift data indicated that this pore-binding site is lost in an M2 construct that contains the TM domain and a curvature-inducing amphipathic helix. We have now obtained chemical shift perturbation, protein-drug proximity, and drug orientation data that indicate that the pore-binding site is restored when the full cytoplasmic domain is present. This finding indicates that the curvature-inducing amphipathic helix distorts the TM structure to interfere with drug binding, while the cytoplasmic tail attenuates this effect. In the second example, we review our studies of a parainfluenza virus fusion protein that merges the cell membrane and the virus envelope during virus entry. Chemical shifts of two hydrophobic domains of the protein indicate that both domains have membrane-dependent backbone conformations, with the β-strand structure dominating in negative-curvature phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) membranes. 31P NMR spectra and 1H-31P correlation spectra indicate that the β-strand-rich conformation induces saddle-splay curvature to PE membranes and dehydrates them, thus stabilizing the hemifusion state.

Wesley D. Allen The Journal of Physical Chemistry A Just Accepted Manuscript DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpca.8b02372

The overarching analytic integrated rate equation for the chemical kinetics of any reversible or irreversible reaction involving an arbitrary number of species and any integral orders is shown to be [EQN1], where ξ(t) is the extent of reaction variable, the fi are roots of a polynomial of order r, the exponents are determined by [EQN2] , and F0 is a factor involving the stoichiometric coefficients and rate constants (k±). All integrated rate equations of elementary reactions appearing in chemical kinetics are special cases of this universal solution. Not only does the solution provide insight into the analytical form of the exponents γi and F0 that govern the time evolution of the system, but it also provides an elegant framework for the pedagogy and application of kinetics in physical chemistry.

"An open-chain imaginary-time path-integral sampling approach to the calculation of approximate symmetrized quantum time correlation functions

Abstract:
We introduce a scheme for approximating quantum time correlation functions numerically within the Feynman path integral formulation. Starting with the symmetrized version of the correlation function expressed as a discretized path integral, we introduce a change of integration variables often used in the derivation of trajectory-based semiclassical methods. In particular, we transform to sum and difference variables between forward and backward complex-time propagation paths. Once the transformation is performed, the potential energy is expanded in powers of the difference variables, which allows us to perform the integrals over these variables analytically. The manner in which this procedure is carried out results in an open-chain path integral (in the remaining sum variables) with a modified potential that is evaluated using imaginary-time path-integral sampling rather than requiring the generation of a large ensemble of trajectories. Consequently, any number of path integral sampling schemes can be employed to compute the remaining path integral, including Monte Carlo, path-integral molecular dynamics, or enhanced path-integral molecular dynamics. We believe that this approach constitutes a different perspective in semiclassical-type approximations to quantum time correlation functions. Importantly, we argue that our approximation can be systematically improved within a cumulant expansion formalism. We test this approximation on a set of one-dimensional problems that are commonly used to benchmark approximate quantum dynamical schemes. We show that the method is at least as accurate as the popular ring-polymer molecular dynamics technique and linearized semiclassical initial value representation for correlation functions of linear operators in most of these examples and improves the accuracy of correlation functions of nonlinear operators.

Abstract
Enhanced sampling techniques such as umbrella sampling and metadynamics are now routinely used to provide information on how the thermodynamic potential, or free energy, depends on a small number of collective variables. The free energy surfaces that one extracts from these techniques thus provide a simplified or coarse-grained representation for the conformational ensemble. In this work we discuss how the information encoded in a free energy surface can be systematically leveraged and how maps in collective variable (CV) space for complementary variables can be constructed. This new procedure allows one to construct a map for any function of the atomic coordinates of the system investigated in CV space and to thus draw conclusions on both the physics of the molecular system under investigation and the quality of the reduced representation of the system that is encoded within a given set of CVs. In this paper we apply this approach to analyze the degeneracy of CVs and to compute entropy and enthalpy surfaces in CV space both for conformational transitions in alanine dipeptide and for phase transitions in carbon dioxide molecular crystals under pressure.
","Rapid Convergence of Energy and Free Energy Profiles with Quantum Mechanical Size in Quantum Mechanical–Molecular Mechanical Simulations of Proton Transfer in DNA

In recent years, a number of quantum mechanical–molecular mechanical (QM/MM) enzyme studies have investigated the dependence of reaction energetics on the size of the QM region using energy and free energy calculations. In this study, we revisit the question of QM region size dependence in QM/MM simulations within the context of energy and free energy calculations using a proton transfer in a DNA base pair as a test case. In the simulations, the QM region was treated with a dispersion-corrected AM1/d-PhoT Hamiltonian, which was developed to accurately describe phosphoryl and proton transfer reactions, in conjunction with an electrostatic embedding scheme using the particle-mesh Ewald summation method. With this rigorous QM/MM potential, we performed rather extensive QM/MM sampling, and found that the free energy reaction profiles converge rapidly with respect to the QM region size within ca. ±1 kcal/mol. This finding suggests that the strategy of QM/MM simulations with reasonably sized and selected QM regions, which has been employed for over four decades, is a valid approach for modeling complex biomolecular systems. We point to possible causes for the sensitivity of the energy and free energy calculations to the size of the QM region, and potential implications."," Title: Improved local lattice Monte Carlo simulation for charged systems

Abstract: Maggs and Rossetto [Phys. Rev. Lett. 88, 196402 (2002)] proposed a local lattice Monte Carlo algorithm for simulating charged systems based on Gauss’s law, which scales with the particle number N as O(N). This method includes two degrees of freedom: the configuration of the mobile charged particles and the electric field. In this work, we consider two important issues in the implementation of the method, the acceptance rate of configurational change (particle move) and the ergodicity in the phase space sampled by the electric field. We propose a simple method to improve the acceptance rate of particle moves based on the superposition principle for electric field. Furthermore, we introduce an additional updating step for the field, named “open-circuit update,” to ensure that the system is fully ergodic under periodic boundary conditions. We apply this improved local Monte Carlo simulation to an electrolyte solution confined between two low dielectric plates. The results show excellent agreement with previous theoretical work.","Hydroxide diffuses slower than hydronium in water because its solvated structure inhibits correlated proton transfer
Mohan Chen, et al

doi:10.1038/s41557-018-0010-2

Proton transfer via hydronium and hydroxide ions in water is ubiquitous. It underlies acid–base chemistry, certain enzyme reactions, and even infection by the flu. Despite two centuries of investigation, the mechanism underlying why hydroxide diffuses slower than hydronium in water is still not well understood. Herein, we employ state-of-the-art density-functional-theory-based molecular dynamics—with corrections for non-local van der Waals interactions, and self-interaction in the electronic ground state—to model water and hydrated water ions. At this level of theory, we show that structural diffusion of hydronium preserves the previously recognized concerted behaviour. However, by contrast, proton transfer via hydroxide is less temporally correlated, due to a stabilized hypercoordination solvation structure that discourages proton transfer. Specifically, the latter exhibits non-planar geometry, which agrees with neutron-scattering results. Asymmetry in the temporal correlation of proton transfer leads to hydroxide diffusing slower than hydronium."

Abstract
The Bayesian Inference of Conformational Populations (BICePs) algorithm reconciles theoretical predictions of conformational state populations with sparse and/or noisy experimental measurements. Among its key advantages is the ability to perform objective model selection through a quantity we call the BICePs score, which reflects the integrated posterior evidence in favor of a given model, computed through free energy estimation methods. Here, we explore how the BICePs score can be used for force field validation and parameterization. Using a 2D lattice protein as a toy model, we demonstrate that BICePs is able to select the correct value of an interaction energy parameter given ensemble-averaged experimental distance measurements. We show that if conformational states are sufficiently fine-grained, the results are robust to experimental noise and measurement sparsity. Using these insights, we apply BICePs to perform force field evaluations for all-atom simulations of designed beta-hairpin peptides against experimental NMR chemical shift measurements. These tests suggest that BICePs scores can be used for model selection in the context of all-atom simulations. We expect this approach to be particularly useful for computational foldamer design, as a tool for improving general-purpose force fields given sparse experimental measurements.
","MELD-path efficiently computes conformational transitions, including multiple and diverse paths

J. Chem. Theory Comput., Just Accepted Manuscript
DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.7b01294The molecular actions of proteins occur along reaction coordinates. Current computer methods have limited ability to explore them. We describe a fast protocol called MELD-path that: (1) efficiently samples relevant conformational states via MELD, an accelerator of Molecular Dynamics (MD), (2) seeds multiple short MD trajectories from MELD states, then (3) constructs Markov State Models (MSM) that give the routes and kinetics. We tested the method against extensive (multi μs) MD simulations of the right-handed- to left-handed-helix transition of a 9-mer peptide of AIB, the symmetry of which allows us to establish convergence. MELD-path finds all the metastable states, their correct relative populations, and the full ensemble of routes, not just a single assumed route. For this transition, we find a very broad route structure. MELD-path is highly parallelizable and efficient, yielding the full route map in a few days of computation. We believe MELD-path could be a general and rapid way to explore mechanistic processes in biomolecules on the computer.

Abstract: We present a simple model of aqueous interfacial molecular structure, and we use this model to isolate the effects of hydrogen bonding on the dielectric properties of the liquid water–vapor interface. We show that water’s interfacial molecular structure can be understood by considering the orientational preferences of a single molecule immersed in the environment of the average interfacial density field. We illustrate that depth-dependent orientational anisotropy is determined by the geometric constraints of hydrogen bonding, and we show that the primary features of atomistic simulation data can be reproduced by assuming an idealized, perfectly tetrahedral hydrogen bonding geometry. We demonstrate that nonideal hydrogen bond geometries are required to account for variations in the orientational polarization and polarizability of the interface. Finally, we highlight that these properties contain significant contributions from a specific type of geometrically distorted three-body hydrogen bond defect that is preferentially stabilized at the interface.","
Assessing Many-Body Effects of Water Self-Ions. I: OH–(H2O)n Clusters

Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation Article ASAP
DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.7b01273 
The importance of many-body effects in the hydration of the hydroxide ion (OH–) is investigated through a systematic analysis of the many-body expansion of the interaction energy carried out at the CCSD(T) level of theory, extrapolated to the complete basis set limit, for the low-lying isomers of OH–(H2O)n clusters, with n = 1–5. This is accomplished by partitioning individual fragments extracted from the whole clusters into “groups” that are classified by both the number of OH– and water molecules and the hydrogen bonding connectivity within each fragment. With the aid of the absolutely localized molecular orbital energy decomposition analysis (ALMO-EDA) method, this structure-based partitioning is found to largely correlate with the character of different many-body interactions, such as cooperative and anticooperative hydrogen bonding, within each fragment. This analysis emphasizes the importance of a many-body representation of inductive electrostatics and charge transfer in modeling OH– hydration. Furthermore, the rapid convergence of the many-body expansion of the interaction energy also suggests a rigorous path for the development of analytical potential energy functions capable of describing individual OH––water many-body terms, with chemical accuracy. Finally, a comparison between the reference CCSD(T) many-body interaction terms with the corresponding values obtained with various exchange-correlation functionals demonstrates that range-separated, dispersion-corrected, hybrid functionals exhibit the highest accuracy, while GGA functionals, with or without dispersion corrections, are inadequate to describe OH––water interactions.

,"Hydrodynamic relaxations in dissipative particle dynamics

The Journal of Chemical Physics  

Volume 148, 2018, pp034503 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4986569   

This paper studies the dynamics of relaxation phenomena in the standard dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) model [R. D. Groot and P. B. Warren, J. Chem. Phys. 107, 4423 (1997)]. Using fluctuating hydrodynamics as the framework of the investigation, we focus on the collective transverse and longitudinal dynamics. It is shown that classical hydrodynamic theory predicts the transverse dynamics at relatively low temperatures very well when compared to simulation data; however, the theory predictions are, on the same length scale, less accurate for higher temperatures. The agreement with hydrodynamics depends on the definition of the viscosity, and here we find that the transverse dynamics are independent of the dissipative and random shear force contributions to the stress. For high temperatures, the spectrum for the longitudinal dynamics is dominated by the Brillouin peak for large length scales and the relaxation is therefore governed by sound wave propagation and is athermal. This contrasts the results at lower temperatures and small length scale, where the thermal process is clearly present in the spectra. The DPD model, at least qualitatively, re-captures the underlying hydrodynamical mechanisms, and quantitative agreement is excellent at intermediate temperatures for the transverse dynamics.","Quantum Simulation of Electronic Structure with Linear Depth and Connectivity

Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 110501As physical implementations of quantum architectures emerge, it is increasingly important to consider the cost of algorithms for practical connectivities between qubits. We show that by using an arrangement of gates that we term the fermionic swap network, we can simulate a Trotter step of the electronic structure Hamiltonian in exactly 
N depth and with N2/2 two-qubit entangling gates, and prepare arbitrary Slater determinants in at most N/2 depth, all assuming only a minimal, linearly connected architecture. We conjecture that no explicit Trotter step of the electronic structure Hamiltonian is possible with fewer entangling gates, even with arbitrary connectivities. These results represent significant practical improvements on the cost of most Trotter-based algorithms for both variational and phase-estimation-based simulation of quantum chemistry.","Title: Analysis of Physicochemical Interaction of Aβ40 with a GM1 Ganglioside-Containing Lipid Membrane
Authors: Majid Vahed, Saburo Neya, Katsumi Matsuzaki, and Tyuji Hoshino
Abstract: The interaction of amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides with the cell membrane is one of the factors enhancing Aβ aggregation, which is closely related to neurodegenerative disease. In this work, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to investigate the initial stage of adhesion of Aβ40 to a GM1 ganglioside-containing membrane. Conformational change of Aβ40 due to interaction with the membrane was monitored and compared with that of Aβ42 observed in the previous study. Multiple computational trials were executed to analyze the probability of Aβ binding using a calculation model consisting of a GM1-containing mixed lipid membrane, a water layer, ions, and Aβ40. A single long-time MD simulation was also carried out. It was suggested from the simulation that a cluster of sialic acids of GM1 head groups often caught the side chain of His13 or His14 of Aβ40 in the early stage of the MD simulations. Afterward, the main chain of Leu34 formed many hydrogen bonds with gangliosides. These residues cooperatively work for Aβ40 to be held on the lipid membrane. It is notable that Aβ40 was observed to be deeply inserted into the head group region of the lipid membrane in some computational trials. In the insertion, Aβ40 occasionally formed a hydrogen bond with sphingomyelin. The difference in the secondary structure between Aβ40 and Aβ42 was an important factor for Aβ40 to be deeply inserted into the membrane.

Molecular dynamics simulation is a powerful method for investigating the structural stability, dynamics, and function of biopolymers at the atomic level. In recent years, it has become possible to perform simulations on time scales of the order of milliseconds using special hardware. However, it is necessary to derive the important factors contributing to structural change or function from the complicated movements of biopolymers obtained from long simulations. Although some analysis methods for protein systems have been developed using increasing simulation times, many of these methods are static in nature (i.e., no information on time). In recent years, dynamic analysis methods have been developed, such as the Markov state model and relaxation mode analysis (RMA), which was introduced based on spin and homopolymer systems. The RMA method approximately extracts slow relaxation modes and rates from trajectories and decomposes the structural fluctuations into slow relaxation modes, which characterize the slow relaxation dynamics of the system. Recently, this method has been applied to biomolecular systems. In this article, we review RMA and its improved versions for protein systems."
"Simplified approach to the mixed time-averaging semiclassical initial value representation for the calculation of dense vibrational spectra

Max Buchholz, Frank Grossmann, and Michele Ceotto
The Journal of Chemical Physics 148, 114107 (2018)

We present and test an approximate method for the semiclassical calculation of vibrational spectra. The approach is based on the mixed time-averaging semiclassical initial value representation method, which is simplified to a form that contains a filter to remove contributions from approximately harmonic environmental degrees of freedom. This filter comes at no additional numerical cost, and it has no negative effect on the accuracy of peaks from the anharmonic system of interest. The method is successfully tested for a model Hamiltonian and then applied to the study of the frequency shift of iodine in a krypton matrix. Using a hierarchic model with up to 108 normal modes included in the calculation, we show how the dynamical interaction between iodine and krypton yields results for the lowest excited iodine peaks that reproduce experimental findings to a high degree of accuracy.","Topology determines force distributions in one-dimensional random spring networks

Networks of elastic fibers are ubiquitous in biological systems and often provide mechanical stability to cells and tissues. Fiber-reinforced materials are also common in technology. An important characteristic of such materials is their resistance to failure under load. Rupture occurs when fibers break under excessive force and when that failure propagates. Therefore, it is crucial to understand force distributions. Force distributions within such networks are typically highly inhomogeneous and are not well understood. Here we construct a simple one-dimensional model system with periodic boundary conditions by randomly placing linear springs on a circle. We consider ensembles of such networks that consist of N nodes and have an average degree of connectivity z but vary in topology. Using a graph-theoretical approach that accounts for the full topology of each network in the ensemble, we show that, surprisingly, the force distributions can be fully characterized in terms of the parameters (N,z). Despite the universal properties of such (N,z) ensembles, our analysis further reveals that a classical mean-field approach fails to capture force distributions correctly. We demonstrate that network topology is a crucial determinant of force distributions in elastic spring networks.","Time-lagged autoencoders: Deep learning of slow collective variables for molecular

Authors: Marco Sbroscia, Armida Sodo, Fabio Bruni, Tommaso Corridoni, and Maria Antonietta Ricci
Abstract: The concept of ions being either water “structure makers” or water “breakers” seems to be inconsistent with the existence of a critical number of water molecules per ion dictating the properties of an aqueous solution, independent of the ion identity. To investigate this issue, Raman spectra of hydroxide aqueous solutions in the region of the OH stretching mode have been obtained under ambient conditions and at concentrations ranging from extreme dilution to the solubility limit. Spectra have been analyzed with a relatively model-free approach, in terms of a superposition of contributions due to the vibrations of the OH– ions, with two contributions due to the solvent. One of these latter contributions falls at wavenumbers very close to that of the OH– stretching band, sharing with it its concentration dependence of the full width at half maximum (FWHM). The other contribution due to the solvent is very broad, with increasing FWHM with increasing ion concentration. In the light of these observations, an interpretation of the Raman spectra, based on the possibility of distinguishing the self and distinct contributions, is proposed. The present analysis is supported by structural data on the same solutions and puts into evidence relevant structural and dynamical changes occurring when the number of water molecules available per solute is below ∼20, irrespective of the ion identity.

The quest of an exact and nonperturbative treatment of quantum dissipation in nonlinear coupling environments remains in general an intractable task. In this work, we address the key issues toward the solutions to the lowest nonlinear environment, a harmonic bath coupled both linearly and quadratically with an arbitrary system. To determine the bath coupling descriptors, we propose a physical mapping scheme, together with the prescription reference invariance requirement. We then adopt a recently developed dissipaton equation of motion theory [R. X. Xu et al., Chin. J. Chem. Phys. 30, 395 (2017)], with the underlying statistical quasi-particle (“dissipaton”) algebra being extended to the quadratic bath coupling. We report the numerical results on a two-level system dynamics and absorption and emission line shapes.","Sequence charge decoration dictates coil-globule transition in intrinsically disordered proteins

Taylor Firman and Kingshuk Ghosh

The Journal of Chemical Physics 

Volume 148, 2018, pp 123305 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5005821

We present an analytical theory to compute conformations of heteropolymers—applicable to describe disordered proteins—as a function of temperature and charge sequence. The theory describes coil-globule transition for a given protein sequence when temperature is varied and has been benchmarked against the all-atom Monte Carlo simulation (using CAMPARI) of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). In addition, the model quantitatively shows how subtle alterations of charge placement in the primary sequence—while maintaining the same charge composition—can lead to significant changes in conformation, even as drastic as a coil (swelled above a purely random coil) to globule (collapsed below a random coil) and vice versa. The theory provides insights on how to control (enhance or suppress) these changes by tuning the temperature (or solution condition) and charge decoration. As an application, we predict the distribution of conformations (at room temperature) of all naturally occurring IDPs in the DisProt database and notice significant size variation even among IDPs with a similar composition of positive and negative charges. Based on this, we provide a new diagram-of-states delineating the sequence-conformation relation for proteins in the DisProt database. Next, we study the effect of post-translational modification, e.g., phosphorylation, on IDP conformations. Modifications as little as two-site phosphorylation can significantly alter the size of an IDP with everything else being constant (temperature, salt concentration, etc.). However, not all possible modification sites have the same effect on protein conformations; there are certain “hot spots” that can cause maximal change in conformation. The location of these “hot spots” in the parent sequence can readily be identified by using a sequence charge decoration metric originally introduced by Sawle and Ghosh. The ability of our model to predict conformations (both expanded and collapsed states) of IDPs at a high-throughput level can provide valuable insights into the different mechanisms by which phosphorylation/charge mutation controls IDP function.",,"Title: Ab Initio Force Fields for Organic Anions: Properties of [BMIM][TFSI], [BMIM][FSI], and [BMIM][OTf] Ionic Liquids
Authors: Jesse G. McDaniel, Chang Yun Son, and Arun Yethiraj
Abstract: Room-temperature ionic liquids (ILs) composed of organic anions bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI), bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (FSI), and trifluoromethanesulfonate (OTf) exhibit interesting physical properties and are important for many electrochemical applications. TFSI and FSI form “hydrophobic” ILs, immiscible with water but miscible with many organic solvents and polymers; for computer simulation studies, it is thus essential to develop force fields for these anions that are transferable among this wide variety of chemical environments. In this work, we develop entirely ab initio force fields for the TFSI, FSI, and OTf anions and predict the properties of corresponding 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium ILs. We discuss important subtleties in the force field development related to accurately modeling conformational flexibility, that is, relaxed torsional profiles and intramolecular electrostatic interactions. The TFSI anions have notable conformational flexibility in the IL, and we predict approximately 70% cisoid and 20% transoid conformations, which is largely driven by cation/anion ion-pair interactions and is opposite to the trend expected from the anion ab initio potential energy surface. The favorable interactions between the cation and cisoid TFSI conformations result in a shoulder in the cation/anion radial distribution function at short distances, whereas interconversion between cisoid and transoid conformations occurs on a commensurate time scale as ion diffusion processes. In addition to this physical insight on anion effects, we expect that these force fields will have important applications for studying a variety of complex electrolyte systems.

"Nuclear quantum effects on the liquid–liquid phase transition of a water-like monatomic liquid
Binh Nguyen,  Gustavo E. Lopez and Nicolas Giovambattista

Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2018,20, 8210-8217 

Polyamorphic substances have the ability to exist in more than one liquid and/or glass states. Examples include water, silicon, and hydrogen. In many of these substances, nuclear quantum effects may become important in the proximity of the liquid–liquid and glass–glass transformation. Here, we study the nuclear quantum effects on a monatomic liquid that exhibits water-like anomalous properties and a liquid–liquid phase transition (LLPT) ending at a liquid–liquid critical point (LLCP). By performing path integral Monte Carlo simulations with different values of the Planck's constant h, we are able to explore how the location of the LLCP/LLPT in the P–T plane shifts as the system evolves from classical, h = 0, to quantum, h > 0. We find that, as the quantum nature of the liquid (as quantified by h) increases, and the atoms in the liquid become more delocalized, the LLCP pressure increases, the LLCP temperature decreases, and the LLCP volume remains constant. In addition, the crystallization temperature decreases with increasing h. For large values of h, the LLCP is not accessible due to rapid crystallization. The structure of the liquids studied at different values of h are also investigated.

Abstract        
As deep Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) frameworks become more widely used for modeling biomolecular simulation data, we emphasize the capability of the VAE architecture to concurrently maximize the timescale of the latent space while inferring a reduced coordinate, which assists in finding slow processes as according to the variational approach to conformational dynamics. We additionally provide evidence that the VDE framework (Hernández et al., 2017), which uses this autocorrelation loss along with a time-lagged reconstruction loss, obtains a variationally optimized latent coordinate in comparison with related loss functions. We thus recommend leveraging the autocorrelation of the latent space while training neural network models of biomolecular simulation data to better represent slow processes.

DOI: 10.1021/jacs.8b01246        
Abstract
Cold-adapted organisms produce antifreeze and ice-nucleating proteins to prevent and promote ice formation. The crystal structure of hyperactive bacterial antifreeze protein (AFP) MpAFP suggests that this protein binds ice through an anchored clathrate motif. It is not known whether other hyperactive AFPs and ice-nucleating proteins (INP) use the same motif to recognize or nucleate ice. Here we use molecular simulations to elucidate the icebinding motifs of hyperactive insect AFPs and a model INP of Ps. syringae. We find that insect AFPs recognize ice through anchored clathrate motifs distinct from that of MpAFP. By performing simulations of ice nucleation by PsINP, we identify two distinct ice-binding sites on opposite sides of the !-helix. The ice nucleating sequences identified in the simulations agree with those previously proposed for the closely related INP of Ps. borealis based on the structure of the protein. The simulations indicate that these sites have comparable ice nucleating efficiency, but distinct binding motifs, controlled by the amino acid sequence: one is anchored clathrate and the other ice-like. We conclude that anchored clathrate and ice-like motifs can be equally effective for binding proteins to ice and promoting ice nucleation.

The equations of motion for the respective collective densities of mass and momentum follow exactly from that of a single element in the flock. The single-particle dynamics has noise and anomalous momentum dependence in its frictional terms. The equations for the collective densities are averaged over a local equilibrium distribution to obtain the corresponding coarse grained equations of fluctuating nonlinear hydrodynamics (FNH). The latter are the equations used frequently for describing active systems on the basis of intuitive arguments. The transport coefficients which appear in the macroscopic FNH equations are determined in terms of the parameters of the microscopic dynamics.

Abstract
In this work, we study the influence of hidden barriers on the convergence behavior of three free-energy calculation methods: well-tempered metadynamics (WTMD), adaptive-biasing forces (ABF), and on-the-fly parameterization (OTFP). We construct a simple two-dimensional potential-energy surfaces (PES) that allows for an exact analytical result for the free-energy in any one-dimensional order parameter. Then we chose different CV definitions and PES parameters to create three different systems with increasing sampling challenges. We find that all three methods are not greatly affected by the hidden-barriers in the simplest case considered. The adaptive sampling methods show faster sampling while the auxiliary high-friction requirement of OTFP makes it slower for this case. However, a slight change in the CV definition has a strong impact in the ABF and WTMD performance, illustrating the importance of choosing suitable collective variables

Abstract
Hyperbranched poly(ethylene imine) (PEI) with its high amino content is a versatile functional polymer that is widely used as a gene delivery vector in biological applications and as a ligand and precursor for ion exchange resins and membranes in water purification and metal recovery. We report here the first fully atomistic model of a 25 kDa hyperbranched PEI macromolecule. We utilized this model to carry out molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with explicit water molecules and chloride ions to study pH-dependent conformational changes. We find that growing the PEI macromolecule sequentially from the monomers yields atomistic structures whose sizes (radius of gyration) are in good agreement with the small angle neutron scattering experiments. Our analysis of the structural properties from MD simulations shows that conformations of the hyperbranched PEI exhibit oblate ellipsoidal elongation at low pH compared to high or neutral pH but with no significant changes in the corresponding sizes. This fully atomistic model of a 25 kDa hyperbranched PEI macromolecule in water provides much needed detailed atomistic information for advancing our fundamental understanding of the structures and host–guest properties of PEI-based functional reagents and materials for biomedical and sustainability related applications",

Abstract
First-principles molecular dynamics (FPMD) simulations based on density functional theory are becoming increasingly popular for the description of liquids. In view of the high computational cost of these simulations, the choice of an appropriate equilibration protocol is critical. We assess two methods of estimation of equilibration times using a large dataset of first-principles molecular dynamics simulations of water. The Gelman-Rubin potential scale reduction factor [A. Gelman and D. B. Rubin, Stat. Sci. 7, 457 (1992)] and the marginal standard error rule heuristic proposed by White [Simulation 69, 323 (1997)] are evaluated on a set of 32 independent 64-molecule simulations of 58 ps each, amounting to a combined cumulative time of 1.85 ns. The availability of multiple independent simulations also allows for an estimation of the variance of averaged quantities, both within MD runs and between runs. We analyze atomic trajectories, focusing on correlations of the Kohn-Sham energy, pair correlation functions, number of hydrogen bonds, and diffusion coefficient. The observed variability across samples provides a measure of the uncertainty associated with these quantities, thus facilitating meaningful comparisons of different approximations used in the simulations. We find that the computed diffusion coefficient and average number of hydrogen bonds are affected by a significant uncertainty in spite of the large size of the dataset used. A comparison with classical simulations using the TIP4P/2005 model confirms that the variability of the diffusivity is also observed after long equilibration times. Complete atomic trajectories and simulation output files are available online for further analysis.",

Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) internalizes plasma membrane by reshaping small regions of the cell surface into spherical vesicles. The key mechanistic question of how coat assembly produces membrane curvature has been studied with molecular and cellular structural biology approaches, without direct visualization of the process in living cells; resulting in two competing models for membrane bending. Here we use polarized total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (pol-TIRF) combined with electron, atomic force, and super-resolution optical microscopy to measure membrane curvature during CME. Surprisingly, coat assembly accommodates membrane bending concurrent with or after the assembly of the clathrin lattice. Once curvature began, CME proceeded to scission with robust timing. Four color pol-TIRF showed that CALM accumulated at high levels during membrane bending, implicating its auxiliary role in curvature generation. We conclude that clathrin-coat assembly is versatile and that multiple membrane-bending trajectories likely reflect the energetics of coat assembly relative to competing forces.","A GPU-Accelerated Parameter Interpolation Thermodynamic Integration Free Energy Method

DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.7b01175

There has been a resurgence of interest in free energy methods motivated by the performance enhancements offered by molecular dynamics (MD) software written for specialized hardware, such as graphics processing units (GPUs). In this work, we exploit the properties of a parameter-interpolated thermodynamic integration (PI-TI) method to connect states by their molecular mechanical (MM) parameter values. This pathway is shown to be better behaved for Mg$^{2+}\rightarrow$Ca$^{2+}$ transformations than traditional linear alchemical pathways (with and without soft-core potentials). The PI-TI method has the practical advantage that no modification of the MD code is required to propagate the dynamics. In the case of AMBER, this enables all the performance benefits of GPU-acceleration to be realized, in addition to unlocking the full spectrum of features available within the MD software, such as Hamiltonian replica exchange (HREM). The TI evaluation can be accomplished efficiently in a post-processing step by reanalyzing the statistically independent trajectory frames in parallel for high throughput. We apply the PI-TI method with HREM on GPUs in AMBER to predict p$K_a$ values in double stranded RNA molecules, and make comparison with experiments. Convergence to under 0.25 units for these systems required 100 ns or more of sampling per window, and coupling of windows with HREM. We find that MM charges derived from {\em ab initio} QM/MM fragment calculations improve the agreement between calculation and experiment.","Computational modeling highlights disordered Formin Homology 1 domain's role in profilin-actin transfer

Formins accelerate actin polymerization, assumed to occur through flexible FH1 domain mediated transfer of profilin-actin to the barbed end. To study FH1 properties and address sequence effects including varying length/distribution of profilin-binding proline-rich motifs, we performed all-atom simulations of mouse mDia1, mDia2; budding yeast Bni1, Bnr1; fission yeast Cdc12, For3, and Fus1 FH1s. We find FH1 has flexible regions between high propensity polyproline helix regions. A coarse-grained model retaining sequence-specificity, assuming rigid polyproline segments, describes their size. Multiple profilins and profilin-actin complexes can simultaneously bind, expanding mDia1-FH1, which may be important in cells. Simulations of the barbed end bound to Bni1-FH1-FH2 dimer show the leading FH1 can better transfer profilin or profilin-actin, having decreasing probability with increasing distance from FH2.

Abstract        
Bottom-up coarse grained (CG) models are now regularly pursued to enable large length and time scale molecular simulations of complex, often macromolecular systems. However, predicting fluid phase equilibria using such models remain fundamentally challenging. A major problem stems from the typically low transferability of CG models beyond the densities and/or compositions at which they are parameterized, which is necessary if they are to describe distinct structural and thermodynamic properties unique to each phase. CG model transferability is compounded by the representation of the inherently multibody coarse interactions using pair potentials that neglect higher order effects. Here, we propose to construct transferable single site CG models of liquid mixtures by supplementing traditional CG pair interactions with local density potentials, which constitute a computationally inexpensive mean-field approach to describe many-body effects, in that site energies are modulated by the local solution environment. To illustrate the approach, we use intra- and inter-species local density potentials to develop CG models of benzene-water solutions that show impressive transferability in structural metrics (pair correlation functions, density profiles) throughout composition space, in contrast to pair-only CG representations. While further refinement may be necessary to represent more complex thermodynamic properties, like the liquid-liquid interfacial tension, the generality and improvement offered by the local density approach is highly encouraging for enabling complex phase equilibrium modeling using CG models..

Satellite tobacco necrosis virus (STNV) is one of the smallest viruses known. Its genome encodes only its coat protein (CP) subunit, relying on the polymerase of its helper virus TNV for replication. The genome has been shown to contain a cryptic set of dispersed assembly signals in the form of stem-loops that each present a minimal CP-binding motif AXXA in the loops. The genomic fragment encompassing nucleotides 1-127 is predicted to contain five such packaging signals (PSs). We have used mutagenesis to determine the critical assembly features in this region. These include the CP-binding motif, the relative placement of PS stem-loops, their number, and their folding propensity. CP binding has an electrostatic contribution, but assembly nucleation is dominated by the recognition of the folded PSs in the RNA fragment. Mutation to remove all AXXA motifs in PSs throughout the genome yields an RNA that is unable to assemble efficiently. In contrast, when a synthetic 127-nt fragment encompassing improved PSs is swapped onto the RNA otherwise lacking CP recognition motifs, assembly is partially restored, although the virus-like particles created are incomplete, implying that PSs outside this region are required for correct assembly. Swapping this improved region into the wild-type STNV1 sequence results in a better assembly substrate than the viral RNA, producing complete capsids and outcompeting the wild-type genome in head-to-head competition. These data confirm details of the PS-mediated assembly mechanism for STNV and identify an efficient approach for production of stable virus-like particles encapsidating nonnative RNAs or other cargoes.","Combination Rules for Morse-Based van der Waals Force Fields

DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpca.7b11252

In traditional force fields (FFs), Van der Waals interactions have been usually described by the Lennard-Jones potentials. All existing combination rules for the parameters of Van der Waals cross-termed interactions were developed for the Lennard-Jones based FFs. Here, we report that the Morse potentials were better function to describe Van der Waals interactions calculated by highly precise quantum mechanics methods. A new set of combination rules was developed for Morse-based FFs, in which Van der Waals (VDW) interactions were described by Morse potentials. The new set of combination rules has been verified by comparing the second virial coefficients of eleven noble gas mixtures. For all the mixed binaries considered in this work, the combination rules work very well and are superior to all existing other three sets of combination rules reported in literatures. We further used the Morse-based FF by using the combination rules to simulate the adsorption isotherms of CH4 at 298 K in four covalent-organic frameworks (COFs). The overall agreement is great which supports the further applications of this new set of combination rules in more realistic simulation systems.","Prediction of Protein Configurational Entropy (Popcoen)

A knowledge-based method for configurational entropy prediction of proteins is presented; this methodology is extremely fast, compared to previous approaches, because it does not involve any type of configurational sampling. Instead, the configurational entropy of a query fold is estimated by evaluating an artificial neural network, which was trained on molecular-dynamics simulations of ∼1000 proteins. The predicted entropy can be incorporated into a large class of protein software based on cost-function minimization/evaluation, in which configurational entropy is currently neglected for performance reasons. Software of this type is used for all major protein tasks such as structure predictions, proteins design, NMR and X-ray refinement, docking, and mutation effect predictions. Integrating the predicted entropy can yield a significant accuracy increase as we show exemplarily for native-state identification with the prominent protein software FoldX. The method has been termed Popcoen for Prediction of Protein Configurational Entropy. An implementation is freely available at http://fmc.ub.edu/popcoen/.

Correlations reduce the configurational entropies of liquids below their ideal gas limits.

We apply this method to liquid aluminum and copper and demonstrate good agreement with experimental measurements, then we apply it to predict the entropy of a liquid aluminum-copper alloy. Corrections due to electronic entropy and many-body correlations are discussed.",

The HIV-1 RNA genome contains complex structures with many structural elements playing regulatory roles during viral replication. A recent study has identified multiple RNA structures with unknown functions that are conserved among HIV-1 and two simian immunodeficiency viruses. To explore the roles of these conserved RNA structures, we introduced synonymous mutations into the HIV-1 genome to disrupt each structure. These mutants exhibited similar particle production, viral infectivity, and replication kinetics relative to the parent NL4-3 virus. However, when replicating in direct competition with the wild-type NL4-3 virus, mutations of RNA structures at inter-protein domain junctions can cause fitness defects. These findings reveal the ability of HIV-1 to tolerate changes in its sequences, even in apparently highly conserved structures, which permits high genetic diversity in HIV-1 population. Our results also suggest that some conserved RNA structures may function to fine-tune viral replication.","Multiscale weighted colored graphs for protein flexibility and rigidity analysis

Protein structural fluctuation, measured by Debye-Waller factors or B-factors, is known to correlate to protein flexibility and function. A variety of methods has been developed for protein Debye-Waller factor prediction and related applications to domain separation, docking pose ranking, entropy calculation, hinge detection, stability analysis, etc. Nevertheless, none of the current methodologies are able to deliver an accuracy of 0.7 in terms of the Pearson correlation coefficients averaged over a large set of proteins. In this work, we introduce a paradigm-shifting geometric graph model, multiscale weighted colored graph (MWCG), to provide a new generation of computational algorithms to significantly change the current status of protein structural fluctuation analysis. Our MWCG model divides a protein graph into multiple subgraphs based on interaction types between graph nodes and represents the protein rigidity by generalized centralities of subgraphs. MWCGs not only predict the B-factors of protein residues but also accurately analyze the flexibility of all atoms in a protein. The MWCG model is validated over a number of protein test sets and compared with many standard methods. An extensive numerical study indicates that the proposed MWCG offers an accuracy of over 0.8 and thus provides perhaps the first reliable method for estimating protein flexibility and B-factors. It also simultaneously predicts all-atom flexibility in a molecule.

Adaptive Boundaries in Multiscale Simulations
Jason A. Wagoner, Vijay S. Pande
https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05555

Combined-resolution simulations are a powerful way to study molecular properties across a range of length- and time-scales. These simulations can benefit from adaptive boundaries that allow the high-resolution region to adapt (change size and/or shape) as the simulation progresses. The number of degrees of freedom required to accurately represent even a simple molecular process can vary by several orders of magnitude throughout the course of a simulation, and adaptive boundaries react to these changes to include an appropriate but not excessive amount of detail. Here, we derive the Hamiltonian and distribution function for such a molecular simulation. We also design an algorithm that can efficiently sample the boundary as a new coordinate of the system. We apply this framework to a mixed explicit/continuum representation of a peptide in solvent. We use this example to discuss the conditions necessary for a successful implementation of adaptive boundaries that is both efficient and accurate in reproducing molecular properties.

Abstract
Water-mediated hydrophobic interactions play an important role in self-assembly processes, aqueous polymer solubility, and protein folding, to name a few. Cosolvents affect these interactions however the implications for hydrophobic polymer collapse and protein folding equilibria are not well-understood. This study examines cosolvent effects on the hydrophobic collapse equilibrium of a generic 32-mer hydrophobic polymer in urea, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), and acetone aqueous solutions using molecular dynamics simulations. Our results unveil a remarkable cosolvent concentration-dependent behavior. Urea, TMAO, and acetone all shift the equilibrium towards collapsed structures below 2 M cosolvent concentration and, in turn, to unfolded structures at higher cosolvent concentrations, irrespective of the differences in cosolvent chemistry and the nature of cosolvent-water interactions. We find that weakly attractive polymer-water van der Waals interactions oppose polymer collapse in pure water, corroborating related observations reviewed by Ben-Amotz (Ann. Rev. Phys. Chem. 2016, 67, 617-638). The cosolvents studied in the present work, adsorb at the polymer/water interface and expel water molecules into the bulk, thereby effectively removing the dehydration energy penalty that opposes polymer collapse in pure water. At low cosolvent concentrations, this leads to cosolvent-induced stabilization of collapsed polymer structures. Only at sufficiently high cosolvent concentrations, polymer-cosolvent interactions favor polymer unfolding.

Existing approaches for allowing proton transfer in the context of classical mechanics are rather cumbersome and have not achieved widespread use and routine status. Here we reconsider the combination of molecular dynamics with periodic stochastic proton hops. To ensure computational efficiency, we propose a non-Boltzmann acceptance criterion that is heuristically adjusted to maintain the correct or desirable thermodynamic equilibria between different protonation states and proton transfer rates. Parameters are proposed for hydronium, Asp, Glu, and His. The algorithm is implemented in the program CHARMM and tested on proton diffusion in bulk water and carbon nanotubes and on proton conductance in the gramicidin A channel. Using hopping parameters determined from proton diffusion in bulk water, the model reproduces the enhanced proton diffusivity in carbon nanotubes and gives a reasonable estimate of the proton conductance in gramicidin A.","(1) Chorlay, A.; Thiam, A.

Polymorphism is a key feature of amyloid fibril structures but it remains challenging to explain these variations for a particular sample. Here, we report electron cryomicroscopy-based reconstructions from different fibril morphologies formed by a peptide fragment from an amyloidogenic immunoglobulin light chain. The observed fibril morphologies vary in the number and cross-sectional arrangement of a structurally conserved building block. A comparison with the theoretically possible constellations reveals the experimentally observed spectrum of fibril morphologies to be governed by opposing sets of forces that primarily arise from the β-sheet twist, as well as peptide–peptide interactions within the fibril cross-section. Our results provide a framework for rationalizing and predicting the structure and polymorphism of cross-β fibrils, and suggest that a small number of physical parameters control the observed fibril architectures.

Abstract
We investigate the problem of artifacts caused by the periodic boundary conditions (PBC) used in molecular simulation studies. Despite the long history of simulations with PBCs, the existence of measurable artifacts originating from PBCs applied to inherently non-periodic physical systems remains controversial. Specifically, these artifacts appear as differences between simulations of the same system but with different simulation-cell sizes. Earlier studies have implied that, even in the simple case of a small model peptide in water, sampling inefficiency is a major obstacle to understanding these artifacts. In this study, we have resolved the sampling issue using the replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) enhanced-sampling method to explore PBC artifacts. Explicitly solvated zwitterionic polyalanine octapeptides with three different cubic-cells, having dimensions of L = 30, 40, and 50 Å, were investigated to elucidate the differences with 64 replica × 500 ns REMD simulations using the AMBER parm99SB force field. The differences among them were not large overall, and the results for the L = 30 and 40 Å simulations in the conformational free energy landscape were found to be very similar at room temperature. However, a small but statistically significant difference was seen for L = 50 Å. We observed that extended conformations were slightly overstabilized in the smaller systems. The origin of these artifacts is discussed by comparison to an electrostatic calculation method without PBCs..

In AEMs with non-blocky polymer structure, where anion transport occurs through narrow (sub-nanometer size) percolating water channels, simulations indicate the importance of the Grotthuss mechanism. In non-reactive simulations, in order to diffuse through bottlenecks in the water channels, the hydroxide anion has to lose part of its hydration structure, therefore creating large kinetic barrier for such events. However, when the Grotthuss mechanism is involved, the hydroxide transport through these bottlenecks can easily occur without loss of anion hydration structure and with a much lower barrier.","(1) Graef, M.

Abstract
During the last decade coarse-grained nucleotide models have emerged that allow us to DNA and RNA on unprecedented time and length scales. Among them is oxDNA, a coarse-grained, sequence-specific model that captures the hybridisation transition of DNA and many structural properties of single- and double-stranded DNA. oxDNA was previously only available as standalone software, but has now been implemented into the popular LAMMPS molecular dynamics code. This article describes the new implementation and analyses its parallel performance. Practical applications are presented that focus on single-stranded DNA, an area of research which has been so far under-investigated. The LAMMPS implementation of oxDNA lowers the entry barrier for using the oxDNA model significantly, facilitates future code development and interfacing with existing LAMMPS functionality as well as other coarse-grained and atomistic DNA models.

Abstract
Here we propose the Reweighted Autoencoded Variational Bayes for Enhanced Sampling (RAVE) method, a new iterative scheme that uses the deep learning framework of variational autoencoders to enhance sampling in molecular simulations. RAVE involves iterations between molecular simulations and deep learning in order to produce an increasingly accurate probability distribution along a low-dimensional latent space that captures the key features of the molecular simulation trajectory. Using the Kullback-Leibler divergence between this latent space distribution and the distribution of various trial reaction coordinates sampled from the molecular simulation, RAVE determines an optimum, yet nonetheless physically interpretable, reaction coordinate and optimum probability distribution. Both then directly serve as the biasing protocol for a new biased simulation, which is once again fed into the deep learning module with appropriate weights accounting for the bias, the procedure continuing until estimates of desirable thermodynamic observables are converged. Unlike recent methods using deep learning for enhanced sampling purposes, RAVE stands out in that (a) it naturally produces a physically interpretable reaction coordinate, (b) is independent of existing enhanced sampling protocols to enhance the fluctuations along the latent space identified via deep learning, and (c) it provides the ability to easily filter out spurious solutions learned by the deep learning procedure. The usefulness and reliability of RAVE is demonstrated by applying it to model potentials of increasing complexity, including computation of the binding free energy profile for a hydrophobic ligand-substrate system in explicit water with dissociation time of more than three minutes, in computer time at least twenty times less than that needed for umbrella sampling or metadynamics..

With growing numbers of structures of the same, or closely related proteins becoming available, it is now possible to understand more about the intrinsic dynamics of a protein with principal component analysis (PCA) of the motions apparent within ensembles of experimental structures. In this paper, we compare the motions extracted from experimental ensembles of 50 different proteins with the modes of motion predicted by several types of coarse-grained elastic network models (ENMs) which additionally take into account more details of either the protein geometry or the amino acid specificity. We further compare the structural variations in the experimental ensembles with the motions sampled in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for a smaller subset of 17 proteins with available trajectories. We find that the correlations between the motions extracted from MD trajectories and experimental structure ensembles are slightly different than for the ENMs, possibly reflecting potential sampling biases. We find that there are small gains in the predictive power of the ENMs in reproducing motions present in either experimental or MD ensembles by accounting for the protein geometry rather than the amino acid specificity of the interactions.","Glass-like stress relaxation of a permanent gelatin network as a signature of pretransitional helix-coil fluctuations 

The Journal of Chemical Physics 148, 054901 (2018)
Christiane Caroli, Olivier Ronsin, and Anaël Lemaître

The stress response of permanently crosslinked gelatin gels was recently observed to display glass-like features, namely, a stretched-exponential behavior terminated by an exponential decay, the characteristic time scales of which increase dramatically with decreasing temperature. This phenomenon is studied here using a model of flexible polymer gel network where relaxation proceeds via elementary monomer exchanges between helix and coil segments. The relaxation dynamics of a full network simulation is found to be nearly identical to that of a model of independent strands, which shows that for flexible polymer gels in the range of elastic moduli of interest, both strand contour length disorder and elastic couplings are irrelevant. We thus focus on the independent strand model and find it not only to explain the observed functional form of the stress relaxation curves but also to yield predictions that match very satisfactorily the experimental measurements of final relaxation time and total stress drop. The system under study thus constitutes a rare case where the origin of glass-like behavior can be unambiguously identified, namely, as the signature of the enhancement of helix content fluctuations when approaching from above the mean-field helix-coil transition of strands.","Identification of Factors Promoting HBV Capsid Self-Assembly by Assembly-Promoting Antivirals

Around 270 million individuals currently live with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Heteroaryldihydropyrimidines (HAPs) are a family of antivirals that target the HBV capsid protein and induce aberrant self-assembly. The capsids formed resemble the native capsid structure but are unable to propagate the virus progeny because of a lack of RNA/DNA. Under normal conditions, self-assembly is initiated by the viral genome. The mode of action of HAPs, however, remains largely unknown. In this work, using molecular dynamics simulations, we attempted to understand the action of HAP by comparing the dynamics of capsid proteins with and without HAPs. We found that the inhibitor is more stable in higher oligomers. It retains its stability in the hexamer throughout 1 μs of simulation. Our results also show that the inhibitor might help in stabilizing the C-terminus, the HBc 149–183 arginine-rich domain of the capsid protein. The C-termini of dimers interact with each other, assisted by the HAP inhibitor. During capsid assembly, the termini are supposed to directly interact with the viral genome, thereby suggesting that the viral genome might work in a similar way to stabilize the capsid protein. Our results may help in understanding the underlying molecular mechanism of HBV capsid self-assembly, which should be crucial for exploring new drug targets and structure-based drug design.
","Development of a Coarse-Grained Model of Collagen-Like Peptide (CLP) for Studies of CLP Triple Helix Melting

J. Phys. Chem. B, Article ASAP
DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b10916
In this paper, we present the development of a phenomenological coarse-grained model that represents single strands of collagen-like peptides (CLPs) as well as CLP triple helices. The goal of this model development is to enable coarse-grained molecular simulations of solutions of CLPs and conjugates of CLPs with other macromolecules and to predict trends in the CLP melting temperature with varying CLP design, namely CLP length and composition. Since the CLP triple helix is stabilized primarily by hydrogen bonds between amino acids in adjacent strands, for modeling CLP melting we get inspiration from a recent coarse-grained (CG) model that was used to capture specific and directional hydrogen-bonding interactions in base-pair hybridization within oligonucleotides and reproduced known DNA melting trends with DNA sequence and composition in implicit water. In this paper, we systematically describe the changes we make to this original CG model and then show that these improvements reproduce the known melting trends of CLPs seen in past experiments. Specifically, the CG simulations of CLP solutions at experimentally relevant concentrations show increasing melting temperature with increasing CLP length and decreasing melting temperature with incorporation of charged residues in place of uncharged residues in the CLP, in agreement with past experimental observations. Finally, results from simulations of CLP triple helices conjugated with elastin like peptides (ELPs), using this new CG model of CLP, reproduce the same trends in ELP aggregation as seen in past experiments.",
"Bilayer sheet protrusions and budding from bilayer membranes induced by hydrolysis and condensation reactions. Koh M. Nakagawa  and  Hiroshi Noguchi. Soft Matter. Advance Article. DOI: 10.1039/C7SM02326J

Shape transformations of flat bilayer membranes and vesicles induced by hydrolysis and condensation reactions of amphiphilic molecules are studied using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. The hydrolysis and condensation reactions result in the formation and dissociation of amphiphilic molecules, respectively. Asymmetric reactions between the inner and outer leaflets of a vesicle can transport amphiphilic molecules between the leaflets. It is found that the resulting area difference between the two leaflets induces bilayer sheet protrusion (BP) and budding at low reduced volumes of the vesicles, whereas BP only occurs at high reduced volumes. The probabilities of these two types of transformations depend on the shear viscosity of the surrounding fluids compared to the membrane as well as the reaction rates. A higher surrounding fluid viscosity leads to more BP formation. The inhomogeneous spatial distribution of the hydrophobic reaction products forms the nuclei of BP formation, and faster diffusion of the products enhances BP formation. Our results suggest that adjustment of the viscosity is important to control membrane shape transformations in experiments.","Maximum Caliber Can Characterize Genetic Switches with Multiple Hidden Species
Taylor Firman, Stephen Wedekind, Thomas J. McMorrow, and Kingshuk Ghosh The Journal of Physical Chemistry B Just Accepted Manuscript DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12251

Gene networks with feedback often involve interactions between multiple species of bio-molecules, much more than experiments can actually monitor. Coupled with this is the challenge that experiments often measure gene expression in noisy fluorescence instead of protein numbers. How do we infer biophysical information and characterize the underlying circuits from this limited and convoluted data? We address this by building stochastic models using the principle of Maximum Caliber (MaxCal). MaxCal uses the basic information of synthesis, degradation, and feedback -- without invoking any other auxiliary species and ad hoc reactions -- to generate stochastic trajectories similar to those typically measured in experiments. MaxCal in conjunction with Maximum Likelihood (ML) can infer parameters of the model using fluctuating trajectories of protein expression over time. We demonstrate the success of the MaxCal + ML methodology using synthetic data generated from known circuits of different genetic switches: i) a single-gene auto-activating circuit involving five species (including mRNA), ii) a mutually repressing two-gene circuit (toggle switch) with seven species (including mRNA) considering stochastic time traces of two proteins, and iii) the same toggle switch circuit considering stochastic time traces of only one of the two proteins. To further challenge the MaxCal + ML inference scheme, we repeat our analysis for the second and third scenario with traces expressed in noisy fluorescence instead of protein number to closely mimic typical experiments. We show that for all of these models with increasing complexity and obfuscation, the minimal model of MaxCal is still able to capture the fluctuations of the trajectory and infer basic underlying rate parameters when benchmarked against the known values used to generate the synthetic data. Importantly, the model also yields an effective feedback parameter that can be used to quantify interactions within these circuits. These applications show the promise of MaxCal's ability to characterize circuits with limited data, and its utility to better understand evolution and advance design strategies for specific functions.

Balancing Force Field Protein–Lipid Interactions To Capture Transmembrane Helix–Helix Association

Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation Article ASAP
DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00983
Atomistic simulations have recently been shown to be sufficiently accurate to reversibly fold globular proteins and have provided insights into folding mechanisms. Gaining similar understanding from simulations of membrane protein folding and association would be of great medical interest. All-atom simulations of the folding and assembly of transmembrane protein domains are much more challenging, not least due to very slow diffusion within the lipid bilayer membrane. Here, we focus on a simple and well-characterized prototype of membrane protein folding and assembly, namely the dimerization of glycophorin A, a homodimer of single transmembrane helices. We have determined the free energy landscape for association of the dimer using the CHARMM36 force field. We find that the native structure is a metastable state, but not stable as expected from experimental estimates of the dissociation constant and numerous experimental structures obtained under a variety of conditions. We explore two straightforward approaches to address this problem and demonstrate that they result in stable dimers with dissociation constants consistent with experimental data.","Multiscale Simulation of Protein Hydration Using the SWINGER Dynamical Clustering Algorithm

DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.7b01129

 To perform computationally effi cient concurrent multiscale simulations of biological macromolecules in solution, where the all-atom (AT) models are coupled to supramolecular coarse-grained (SCG) solvent models,
previous studies resorted to modifi ed AT water models, such as the bundled-simple point charge (SPC) models, that use semiharmonic springs to restrict the relative movement of water molecules within a cluster. Those models can have a signifi can’t impact on the simulated biomolecules and can lead, for example, to a partial unfolding of a protein. In this work, we employ the recently developed alternative approach with a dynamical clustering algorithm, SWINGER, which enables a direct coupling of original unmodifi ed AT and SCG water models. We perform an adaptive resolution molecular dynamics simulation of a Trp-Cage miniprotein in multiscale water, where the standard SPC water model is interfaced with the widely used MARTINI SCG model, and demonstrate that, compared to the corresponding full-blown AT simulations, the structural and dynamic properties of the solvated protein and surrounding solvent are well reproduced by our approach.",
"Molecular enhanced sampling with autoencoders: On-the-fly collective variable discovery and accelerated free energy landscape exploration
Wei Chen and Andrew L Ferguson
arXiv:1801.00203v1 [physics.bio-ph]
Macromolecular and biomolecular folding landscapes typically contain high free energy barriers that impede efficient sampling of configurational space by standard molecular dynamics simulation. Biased sampling can artificially drive the simulation along pre-specified collective variables (CVs), but success depends critically on the availability of good CVs associated with the important collective dynamical motions. Nonlinear machine learning techniques can identify such CVs but typically do not furnish an explicit relationship with the atomic coordinates necessary to perform biased sampling. In this work, we employ auto-associative artificial neural networks (""autoencoders"") to learn nonlinear CVs that are explicit and differentiable functions of the atomic coordinates. Our approach offers substantial speedups in exploration of configurational space, and is distinguished from exiting approaches by its capacity to simultaneously discover and directly accelerate along data-driven CVs. We demonstrate the approach in simulations of alanine dipeptide and Trp-cage, and have developed an open-source and freely-available implementation within OpenMM.
","Computing the free energy without collective variables
Alex Rodriguez, Maria d'Errico, Elena facco, and Alessandro Laio Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation Just Accepted Manuscript DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00916

We introduce an approach for computing the free energy and the probability density in high-dimensional spaces, like those explored in molecular dynamics simulations of biomolecules. The approach exploits the presence of correlations between the coordinates, induced, in molecular dynamics, by the chemical nature of the molecules. Due to these correlations, the data points lay on a manifold that can be highly curved and twisted, but whose dimension is normally small. We estimate the free energies by finding, with a statistical test, the largest neighborhood in which the free energy in the embedding manifold can be considered constant. Importantly, this procedure does not require defining explicitly the manifold and provides an estimate of the error, that is approximately unbiased up to large dimensions. We test this approach on artificial and real data sets, demonstrating that the free energy estimates are reliable for date sets on manifolds of dimension up to ~ 10, embedded in an arbitrarily large space. In practical applications our method permits the estimation of the free energy in a space of reduced dimensionality without specifying the collective variables defining this space.","Unraveling the Binding, Proton Blockage, and Inhibition of Influenza M2 WT and S31N by Rimantadine Variants

Recently, the binding kinetics of a ligand–target interaction, such as the residence time of a small molecule on its protein target, are seen as increasingly important for drug efficacy. Here, we investigate these concepts to explain binding and proton blockage of rimantadine variants bearing progressively larger alkyl groups to influenza A virus M2 wild type (WT) and M2 S31N protein proton channel. We showed that resistance of M2 S31N to rimantadine analogues compared to M2 WT resulted from their higher koff rates compared to the kon rates according to electrophysiology (EP) measurements. This is due to the fact that, in M2 S31N, the loss of the V27 pocket for the adamantyl cage resulted in low residence time inside the M2 pore. Both rimantadine enantiomers have similar channel blockage and binding kon and koff against M2 WT. To compare the potency between the rimantadine variants against M2, we applied approaches using different mimicry of M2, i.e., isothermal titration calorimetry and molecular dynamics simulation, EP, and antiviral assays. It was also shown that a small change in an amino acid at site 28 of M2 WT, which does not line the pore, seriously affects M2 WT blockage kinetics.","Molecular Dynamics Coupled with a Virtual System for Effective Conformational Sampling
Tomonori Hayami, Kota Kasahara, Haruki Nakamura, Junichi Higo
DOI: 10.1002/jcc.25196
An enhanced conformational sampling method is proposed: virtual-system coupled canonical molecular dynamics (VcMD). Although VcMD enhances sampling along a reaction coordinate, this method is free from estimation of a canonical distribution function along the reaction coordinate. This method introduces a virtual system that does not necessarily obey a physical law. To enhance sampling the virtual system couples with a molecular system to be studied. Resultant snapshots produce a canonical ensemble. This method was applied to a system consisting of two short peptides in an explicit solvent. Conventional molecular dynamics simulation, which is ten times longer than VcMD, was performed along with adaptive umbrella sampling. Free-energy landscapes computed from the three simulations mutually converged well. The VcMD provided quicker association/dissociation motions of peptides than the conventional molecular dynamics did. The VcMD method is applicable to various complicated systems because of its methodological simplicity.

"Hybrid Particle-Field Model for Conformational Dynamics of Peptide Chains
Sigbjørn Løland Bore, Giuseppe Milano and Michele Cascella
J. Chem. Theory Comput., Article ASAP (2018) doi: 10.1021/acs.jctc.7b01160
We propose the first model of a polypeptide chain based on a hybrid-particle field approach. The intramolecular potential is built on a two-bead coarse grain mapping for each amino acid. We employ a combined potential for the bending and the torsional degrees of freedom that ensures the stabilization of secondary structure elements in the conformational space of the polypeptide. The electrostatic dipoles associated with the peptide bonds of the main chain are reconstructed by a topological procedure. The intermolecular interactions comprising both the solute and the explicit solvent are treated by a density functional-based mean-field potential. Molecular dynamics simulations on a series of test systems show how the model here introduced is able to capture all the main features of polypeptides. In particular, homopolymers of different lengths yield a complex folding phase diagram, covering from the collapsed to swollen state. Moreover, simulations on models of a four-helix bundle and of an alpha + beta peptide evidence how the collapse of the hydrophobic core drives the appearance of both folded motifs and the stabilization of tertiary or quaternary assemblies. Finally, the polypeptide model is able to structurally respond to the environmental changes caused by the presence of a lipid bilayer.
","Reconstruction of atomistic structures from coarse-grained models for protein-DNA complexes
Masahiro Shimizu and Shoji Takada Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation Just Accepted Manuscript DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00954

While coarse-grained (CG) simulations have widely been used to accelerate structure sampling of large biomolecular complexes, they are unavoidably less accurate and thus the reconstruction of all-atom (AA) structures and the subsequent refinement is of desire. In this study we developed an efficient method to reconstruct AA structures from sampled CG protein-DNA complex models, which attempts to model protein-DNA interface accurately. First we developed a method to reconstruct atomic details of DNA structures from a 3-site per nucleotide CG model which uses a DNA fragment library. Next, for the protein-DNA interface, we referred to the sidechain orientations in the known structure of the target interface when available. The other parts are modeled by existing tools. We confirmed the accuracy of the protocol in various aspects including the structure deviation in the self-reproduction, the base pair reproducibility, atomic contacts at the protein-DNA interface, and feasibility of the posterior AA simulations.","Integrating Multiple Accelerated Molecular Dynamics To Improve Accuracy of Free Energy Calculations

Accelerated Molecular Dynamics (aMD) is a promising enhanced sampling method to explore the conformational space of biomolecules. However, the large statistical noise in reweighting limits its accuracy to recover the original free energy profile. In this work, we propose an Integrated accelerated Molecule Dynamics (IaMD) method by integrating a series of aMD subterms with different acceleration parameters to improve the sampling efficiency and maintain the reweighting accuracy simultaneously. We use Alanine Dipeptide and three fast-folded proteins (Chignolin, Trp-cage, and Villin Headpiece) as the test objects to compare our IaMD method with aMD systematically. These case studies indicate that the statistical noise of IaMD in reweighting for free energy profiles is much smaller than that of aMD at the same level of acceleration and simulation time. To achieve the same accuracy as IaMD, aMD requires 1–3 orders of magnitude longer simulation time, depending on the complexity of the simulated system and the level of acceleration. Our method also outperforms aMD in controlling systematic error caused by the disappearance of the low-energy conformations when high acceleration parameters are used in aMD simulations for fast-folded proteins. Furthermore, the performance comparison between IaMD and the Integrated Tempering Sampling (ITS) in the case of Alanine Dipeptide demonstrates that IaMD possesses a better ability to control the potential energy region of sampling.","CAMERRA: An Analysis Tool for the Computation of Conformational Dynamics by Evaluating Residue–Residue Associations
Quentin R. Johnson, Richard J. Lindsay, Tongye Shen
DOI:10.1002/jcc.25192
A computational method which extracts the dominant motions from an ensemble of biomolecular conformations via a correlation analysis of residue–residue contacts is presented. The algorithm first renders the structural information into contact matrices, then constructs the collective modes based on the correlated dynamics of a selected set of dynamic contacts. Associated programs can bridge the results for further visualization using graphics software. The aim of this method is to provide an analysis of conformations of biopolymers from the contact viewpoint. It may assist a systematical uncovering of conformational switching mechanisms existing in proteins and biopolymer systems in general by statistical analysis of simulation snapshots. In contrast to conventional correlation analyses of Cartesian coordinates (such as distance covariance analysis and Cartesian principal component analysis), this program also provides an alternative way to locate essential collective motions in general. Herein, we detail the algorithm in a stepwise manner and comment on the importance of themethod as applied to decoding allosteric mechanisms.",
"Theory for the Liquid–Liquid Phase Separation in Aqueous Antibody Solutions
Miha Kastelic and Vojko Vlachy
J. Phys. Chem. B, Article ASAP (2018) doi: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b11458
This study presents the theory for liquid–liquid phase separation for systems of molecules modeling monoclonal antibodies. Individual molecule is depicted as an assembly of seven hard spheres, organized to mimic the Y-shaped antibody. We consider the antibody–antibody interactions either through Fab, Fab′ (two Fab fragments may be different), or Fc domain. Interaction between these three domains of the molecule (hereafter denoted as A, B, and C, respectively) is modeled by a short-range square-well attraction. To obtain numerical results for the model under study, we adapt Wertheim’s thermodynamic perturbation theory. We use this model to calculate the liquid–liquid phase separation curve and the second virial coefficient B2. Various interaction scenarios are examined to see how the strength of the site–site interactions and their range shape the coexistence curve. In the asymmetric case, where an attraction between two sites is favored and the interaction energies for the other sites kept constant, critical temperature first increases and than strongly decreases. Some more microscopic information, for example, the probability for the particular two sites to be connected, has been calculated. Analysis of the experimental liquid–liquid phase diagrams, obtained from literature, is presented. In addition, we calculate the second virial coefficient under conditions leading to the liquid–liquid phase separation and present this quantity on the graph B2 versus protein concentration.
","Free Energy Calculations of Membrane Permeation:Challenges due to Strong Headgroup–Solute Interactions
Nihit Pokhrel and Lutz Maibaum Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation Just Accepted Manuscript DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.7b01159

Understanding how different classes of molecules move across biological membranes is a prerequisite to predicting a solute’s permeation rate, which is a critical factor in the fields of drug design and pharmacology. We use biased Molecular Dynamics computer simulations to calculate and compare the free energy profiles of translocation of several small molecules across 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) lipid bilayers as a first step towards determining the most efficient method for free energy calculations. We study the translocation of arginine, a sodium ion, alanine, and a single water molecule using the Metadynamics, Umbrella Sampling, and Replica Exchange Umbrella Sampling techniques. Within the fixed lengths of our simulations, we find that all methods produce similar results for charge-neutral permeants, but not for polar or positively charged molecules. We identify the long relaxation timescale of electrostatic interactions between lipid headgroups and the solute to be the principal cause of this difference, and show that this slow process can lead to an erroneous dependence of computed free energy profiles on the initial system configuration. We demonstrate the use of committor analysis to validate the proper sampling of the presumed transition state, which in our simulations is achieved only in replica exchange calculations. Based on these results we provide some useful guidance to perform and evaluate free energy calculations of membrane permeation.","Shin, S., and A.P. Willard. 2018. Characterizing Hydration Properties Based on the Orientational Structure of Interfacial Water Molecules. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 14: 461–5.

In this manuscript, we present a general computational method for characterizing the molecular structure of liquid water interfaces as sampled from atomistic simulations. With this method, the interfacial structure is quantified based on the statistical analysis of the orientational configurations of interfacial water molecules. The method can be applied to generate position dependent maps of the hydration properties of heterogeneous surfaces. We present an application to the characterization of surface hydrophobicity, which we use to analyze simulations of a hydrated protein. We demonstrate that this approach is capable of revealing microscopic details of the collective dynamics of a protein hydration shell.","A Reactive Dynamics Simulation Study on the Pyrolysis of Polymer Precursor to Generate Amorphous Silicon Oxycarbide Structure

Hong-fei Gao, Hongjie Wang, Zihao Zhao, Min Niu, Lei Su, and Yin Wei The Journal of Physical Chemistry C Just Accepted Manuscript DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b12287

Amorphous silicon oxycarbide (SiOC) ceramics have extensive applications as structural and functional materials due to their unique properties. Preparation of SiOC from pyrolysis of polymer precursors involves a complicated process of chemical reactions, various bond redistributions and so on. With the aim to gain more insight on this and obtain a SiOC structure model, a series of molecule dynamics (MD) simulations integrated with a shell programming of gas removal scheme were implemented. Here we chose hydridopolycarbosilane (HPCS) and polymethylhydrosiloxane (PMHS) as polymer precursors, and constructed a rational polymer atomic model by using reactive force field ReaxFF derived from elsewhere, which has been tested and verified to be applicable to our C/Si/H/O system. MD simulation of pyrolysis of the polymer indicated H2 and CH4 were the major gas products, which were deleted through NVT-MD simulations cooperated with the script code mimicking the experimental process. Atomic model of the dense SiOC was obtained after compressed and further equilibrated of the solid structure. The final SiOC structure was analyzed by computing its radial distribution function. It contains C-C, Si-O, Si-C, and Si-Si bonds, which agrees well with the experimental data. These results confirm the accuracy of the MD simulations and the atomic model of SiOC ceramic.",

doi:10.1038/s41467-017-02669-9
Infrared continuum bands that extend over a broad frequency range are a key spectral signature of protonated water clusters. They are observed for many membrane proteins that contain internal water molecules, but their microscopic mechanism has remained unclear. Here we compute infrared spectra for protonated and unprotonated water chains, discs, and droplets from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. The continuum bands of the protonated clusters exhibit significant anisotropy for chains and discs, with increased absorption along the direction of maximal cluster extension. We show that the continuum band arises from the nuclei motion near the excess charge, with a long-ranged amplification due to the electronic polarizability. Our experimental, polarization-resolved light–dark difference spectrum of the light-driven proton pump bacteriorhodopsin exhibits a pronounced dichroic continuum band. Our results suggest that the protonated water cluster responsible for the continuum band of bacteriorhodopsin is oriented perpendicularly to the membrane normal.
","Markov modeling of peptide folding in the presence of protein crowders
Nilsson, Daniel Mohanty, Sandipan Irbäck, Anders The Journal of Chemical Physics 148, 055101 (2018); https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5017031

We use Markov state models (MSMs) to analyze the dynamics of a β-hairpin-forming peptide in Monte Carlo (MC) simulations with interacting protein crowders, for two different types of crowder proteins [bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) and GB1]. In these systems, at the temperature used, the peptide can be folded or unfolded and bound or unbound to crowder molecules. Four or five major free-energy minima can be identified. To estimate the dominant MC relaxation times of the peptide, we build MSMs using a range of different time resolutions or lag times. We show that stable relaxation-time estimates can be obtained from the MSM eigenfunctions through fits to autocorrelation data. The eigenfunctions remain sufficiently accurate to permit stable relaxation-time estimation down to small lag times, at which point simple estimates based on the corresponding eigenvalues have large systematic uncertainties. The presence of the crowders has a stabilizing effect on the peptide, especially with BPTI crowders, which can be attributed to a reduced unfolding rate ku, while the folding rate kf is left largely unchanged.
","Wang, J.C.Y., S. Mukhopadhyay, and A. Zlotnick. 2018. Geometric defects and icosahedral viruses. Viruses. 10: 1–9.

We propose that viruses with geometric defects are not necessarily flawed viruses. A geometric defect may be a reactive site. Defects may facilitate assembly, dissociation, or accessibility of cellular proteins to virion components. In single molecule studies of hepadnavirus assembly, defects and overgrowth are common features. Icosahedral alphaviruses and flaviviruses, among others, have capsids with geometric defects. Similarly, immature retroviruses, which are non-icosahedral, have numerous “errors”. In many viruses, asymmetric exposure of interior features allows for regulated genome release or supports intracellular trafficking. In these viruses, the defects likely serve a biological function. Commonly used approaches for spherical virus structure determination use symmetry averaging, which obscures defects. We suggest that there are three classes of asymmetry: regular asymmetry as might be found in a tailed phage, irregular asymmetry as found, for example, in defects randomly trapped during assembly, and dynamic asymmetry due to Brownian dynamics of virus capsids. Awareness of their presence and recent advances in electron microscopy will allow unprecedented investigation of capsid irregularities to investigate their biological relevance.","A Virtual Site OPLS Force Field for Imidazolium-Based Ionic Liquids

Brian Doherty, Xiang Zhong, and Orlando Acevedo The Journal of Physical Chemistry B Just Accepted Manuscript DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b11996

Molecular simulations of ionic liquids can provide deeper insight into the relationship between intermolecular interactions and macroscopic measurements for the solvents. However, many existing force fields have multiple shortcomings, including poor solvent dynamics, the underestimation of hydrogen bonding strength, and errors in solvent interactions/organization. A new force field, called OPLS-VSIL, has been developed for imidazolium-based ionic liquids featuring a novel topology incorporating a virtual site bisecting the nitrogen atoms that offloads negative charge to inside the plane of the ring. Guided by free energy of hydration calculations, an empirically-derived set of partial charges and nonbonded Lennard-Jones terms for both 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium [RMIM] and 11 different anions provided accurate bulk phase ionic liquid properties and produced radial distribution functions nearly indistinguishable from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. For example, overall mean absolute errors (MAE) of 3.1–3.4% were computed for the density, heat of vaporization, and viscosity of approximately 20 different ion pair combinations. Additional physical properties, such as, self-diffusion coefficients, heat capacity, and surface tension also gave significant MAE improvements using OPLS-VSIL compared to existing fixed charge ionic liquid force fields. Local interactions, including cation-anion hydrogen bonding and π-π stacking between the imidazolium rings, were also accurately reproduced.

Chemical Reviews Article ASAP
DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemrev.7b00664
This review focuses on the type A cytochrome c oxidases (CcO), which are found in all mitochondria and also in several aerobic bacteria. CcO catalyzes the respiratory reduction of dioxygen (O2) to water by an intriguing mechanism, the details of which are fairly well understood today as a result of research for over four decades. Perhaps even more intriguingly, the membrane-bound CcO couples the O2 reduction chemistry to translocation of protons across the membrane, thus contributing to generation of the electrochemical proton gradient that is used to drive the synthesis of ATP as catalyzed by the rotary ATP synthase in the same membrane. After reviewing the structure of the core subunits of CcO, the active site, and the transfer paths of electrons, protons, oxygen, and water, we describe the states of the catalytic cycle and point out the few remaining uncertainties. Finally, we discuss the mechanism of proton translocation and the controversies in that area that still prevail.

","Title: Born–Oppenheimer Molecular Dynamics Simulations of a Bromate Ion in Water Reveal Its Dual Kosmotropic and Chaotropic Behavior
Authors: The Journal of Physical Chemistry B Article ASAP
Abstract: The solvation structure and dynamics of a bromate (BrO3–) ion in water are studied by means of Born–Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulations at two different temperatures using the Becke–Lee–Yang–Parr functional with Grimme D3 dispersion corrections. The bromate ion possesses a pyramidal structure, and it has two types of solvation sites, namely, the bromine and oxygen atoms. We have looked at different radial and orientational distributions of water molecules around the bromate ion and also investigated their hydrogen bonding properties. The solvation structure of the bromate ion is also compared with that of the iodate (IO3–) ion, which is structurally rather similar to the bromate ion and was found to have some unusual solvation properties in water. It is found that the bromate ion follows a similar trend as that followed by the iodate ion as far as the solvation structure is concerned. However, the effect of the former on surrounding water is found to be much weaker than that of the latter. On the dynamical side, we have looked at diffusion, residence dynamics, and also the orientational and hydrogen bond relaxation of water molecules around the BrO3– ion and compared them with those of the bulk. Dynamical results are presented for both H2O and D2O around the BrO3– ion. Interpretation of the dynamical results in terms of structure-making (kosmotropic)/-breaking (chaotropic) properties of the BrO3– ion reveals that the bromine atom of this ion acts as a water structure breaker, whereas the three oxygens act as water structure makers. Thus, in spite of being a single ion, the bromate ion has dual characteristics and the experimentally observed kosmotropic ability of this ion is actually a trade-off between a chaotropic site (the bromine atom) and three kosmotropic sites (three oxygen atoms) that are present in the ion.

Cytokinesis is the process by which a mother cell is physically cleaved into two daughter cells. In animal cells, cytokinesis begins with the contraction of a plasma membrane-associated actomyosin ring that is responsible for the ingression of a cleavage furrow. However, the post-furrowing steps of cytokinesis are less understood. Here, we highlight key recent findings that reveal a profound remodeling of several classes of cytoskeletal elements and cytoplasmic filaments (septins, microtubules, actin and ESCRT) in the late steps of cytokinesis. We review how this remodeling is required first for the stabilization of the intercellular bridge connecting the daughter cells and then for the steps leading up to abscission. New players regulating the abscission (NoCut) checkpoint, which delays abscission via cytoskeleton and ESCRT remodeling in response to various cytokinetic stresses, will also be emphasized. Altogether, the latest discoveries reveal a crucial role for posttranslational modifications of the cytoskeleton (actin oxidation, septin SUMOylation) and an unexpected requirement of ESCRT-III polymer dynamics for successful abscission.","Density-Dependent Formulation of Dispersion–Repulsion Interactions in Hybrid Multiscale Quantum/Molecular Mechanics (QM/MM) Models

Mixed multiscale quantum/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) models are widely used to explore the structure, reactivity, and electronic properties of complex chemical systems. Whereas such models typically include electrostatics and potentially polarization in so-called electrostatic and polarizable embedding approaches, respectively, nonelectrostatic dispersion and repulsion interactions are instead commonly described through classical potentials despite their quantum mechanical origin. Here we present an extension of the Tkatchenko–Scheffler semiempirical van der Waals (vdWTS) scheme aimed at describing dispersion and repulsion interactions between quantum and classical regions within a QM/MM polarizable embedding framework. Starting from the vdWTS expression, we define a dispersion and a repulsion term, both of them density-dependent and consistently based on a Lennard-Jones-like potential. We explore transferable atom type-based parametrization strategies for the MM parameters, based on either vdWTS calculations performed on isolated fragments or on a direct estimation of the parameters from atomic polarizabilities taken from a polarizable force field. We investigate the performance of the implementation by computing self-consistent interaction energies for the S22 benchmark set, designed to represent typical noncovalent interactions in biological systems, in both equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium geometries. Overall, our results suggest that the present implementation is a promising strategy to include dispersion and repulsion in multiscale QM/MM models incorporating their explicit dependence on the electronic density.",
"A GPU-Accelerated Parameter Interpolation Thermodynamic Integration Free Energy Method
Timothy J. Giese and Darrin M. York
Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation Just Accepted Manuscript
DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.7b01175
There has been a resurgence of interest in free energy methods motivated by the performance enhancements offered by molecular dynamics (MD) software written for specialized hardware, such as graphics processing units (GPUs). In this work, we exploit the properties of a parameter-interpolated thermodynamic integration (PI-TI) method to connect states by their molecular mechanical (MM) parameter values. This pathway is shown to be better behaved for Mg$^{2+}\rightarrow$Ca$^{2+}$ transformations than traditional linear alchemical pathways (with and without soft-core potentials). The PI-TI method has the practical advantage that no modification of the MD code is required to propagate the dynamics. In the case of AMBER, this enables all the performance benefits of GPU-acceleration to be realized, in addition to unlocking the full spectrum of features available within the MD software, such as Hamiltonian replica exchange (HREM). The TI evaluation can be accomplished efficiently in a post-processing step by reanalyzing the statistically independent trajectory frames in parallel for high throughput. We apply the PI-TI method with HREM on GPUs in AMBER to predict p$K_a$ values in double stranded RNA molecules, and make comparison with experiments. Convergence to under 0.25 units for these systems required 100 ns or more of sampling per window, and coupling of windows with HREM. We find that MM charges derived from {\em ab initio} QM/MM fragment calculations improve the agreement between calculation and experiment.","Title: Water Lone Pair Delocalization in Classical and Quantum Descriptions of the Hydration of Model Ions
Authors: Richard C. Remsing, Timothy T. Duignan, Marcel D. Baer, Gregory K. Schenter, Christopher J. Mundy, and John D. Weeks
Abstract: Understanding the nature of ionic hydration at a fundamental level has eluded scientists despite intense interest for nearly a century. In particular, the microscopic origins of the asymmetry of ion solvation thermodynamics with respect to the sign of the ionic charge remains a mystery. Here, we determine the response of accurate quantum mechanical water models to strong nanoscale solvation forces arising from excluded volumes and ionic electrostatic fields. This is compared to the predictions of two important limiting classes of classical models of water with fixed point changes, differing in their treatment of “lone pair” electrons. Using the quantum water model as our standard of accuracy, we find that a single fixed classical treatment of lone pair electrons cannot accurately describe solvation of both apolar and cationic solutes, emphasizing the need for a more flexible description of local electronic effects in solvation processes. However, we explicitly show that all water models studied respond to weak long-ranged electrostatic perturbations in a manner that follows macroscopic dielectric continuum models, as would be expected. We emphasize the importance of these findings in the context of realistic ion models, using density functional theory and empirical models, and discuss the implications of our results for quantitatively accurate reduced descriptions of solvation in dielectric media.

Quantum thermodynamic parameters can be determined using path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations. These simulations, however, become computationally demanding as the quantum nature of the system increases, although their efficiency can be improved by using higher order approximations to the thermal density matrix, specifically the action. Here we compare the standard, primitive approximation to the action (PA) and three higher order approximations, the Takahashi-Imada action (TIA), the Suzuki-Chin action (SCA) and the Chin action (CA). The resulting PIMC methods are applied to two realistic potential energy surfaces, for H2O and HCN–HNC, both of which are spectroscopically accurate and contain three-body interactions. We further numerically optimise, for each potential, the SCA parameter and the two free parameters in the CA, obtaining more significant improvements in efficiency than seen previously in the literature. For both H2O and HCN–HNC, accounting for all required potential and force evaluations, the optimised CA formalism is approximately twice as efficient as the TIA formalism and approximately an order of magnitude more efficient than the PA. The optimised SCA formalism shows similar efficiency gains to the CA for HCN–HNC but has similar efficiency to the TIA for H2O at low temperature. In H2O and HCN–HNC systems, the optimal value of the a1 CA parameter is approximately 1313, corresponding to an equal weighting of all force terms in the thermal density matrix, and similar to previous studies, the optimal α parameter in the SCA was ∼0.31. Importantly, poor choice of parameter significantly degrades the performance of the SCA and CA methods. In particular, for the CA, setting a1 = 0 is not efficient: the reduction in convergence efficiency is not offset by the lower number of force evaluations. We also find that the harmonic approximation to the CA parameters, whilst providing a fourth order approximation to the action, is not optimal for these realistic potentials: numerical optimisation leads to better approximate cancellation of the fifth order terms, with deviation between the harmonic and numerically optimised parameters more marked in the more quantum H2O system. This suggests that numerically optimising the CA or SCA parameters, which can be done at high temperature, will be important in fully realising the efficiency gains of these formalisms for realistic potentials.

Authors: Tatiana I. Morozova and Arash Nikoubashman
Abstract: We study the coil and globule states of a single polymer chain in solution by performing molecular dynamics simulations with a united atom model. Specifically, we characterize the structural properties of atactic polystyrene chains with N = 20–150 monomers in tetrahydrofuran–water mixtures at varying mixing ratios. We find that the hydrophobic polymers form rather open coils when the mole fraction of water, XW, is roughly below 0.25, whereas the chains collapse into globules when XW ≳ 0.75. We confirm the theoretically expected scaling laws for the radius of gyration, Rg, in these regimes, i.e., Rg ∝ N3/5 and Rg ∝ N1/3 for good and poor solvent conditions, respectively. For poor solvent conditions with XW = 0.75, we find a sizable fraction of residual tetrahydrofuran trapped inside the collapsed polymer chains with an excess amount located at the globule surface, acting as a protective layer between the hydrophobic polystyrene and the surrounding water-rich mixture. These findings have important implications for nanoparticle fabrication techniques where solvent exchange is exploited to drive polymer aggregation, since residual solvent can significantly influence the physical properties of the precipitated nanoparticles.

William B. Carpenter, Joseph A. Fournier, Nicholas H.C. Lewis, and Andrei Tokmakoff The Journal of Physical Chemistry B Just Accepted Manuscript DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b00118

Aqueous proton transport involves the ultrafast interconversion of hydrated proton species that are closely linked to the hydrogen bond dynamics of water, which has been a long-standing challenge to experiments. In this paper, we use ultrafast IR spectroscopy to investigate the distinct vibrational transition centered at 1750 cm-1 in strong acid solutions, which arises from bending vibrations of the hydrated proton complex. Broadband ultrafast 2D IR spectroscopy and transient absorption are used to measure vibrational relaxation, spectral diffusion, and orientational relaxation dynamics. The hydrated proton bend displays fast vibrational relaxation and spectral diffusion timescales of 200-300 fs; however, the transient absorption anisotropy decays on a remarkably long 2.5 ps timescale, which matches the timescale for hydrogen bond reorganization in liquid water. These observations are indications that the bending vibration of the aqueous proton complex is relatively localized, with an orientation that is insensitive to fast hydrogen-bonding fluctuations, and dependent on collective structural relaxation of the liquid in order to reorient. We conclude that the orientational relaxation is a result of proton transfer between configurations that are well described by a Zundel-like proton shared between two flanking water molecules.",

Abstract Experimental Raman multivariate curve resolution (Raman-MCR) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are performed to demonstrate that the vibrational frequency and tetrahedrality of water molecules in the hydration-shells of short-chain alcohols differ from pure water and undergo a crossover above 100○C (at 30 MPa) to a structure that is less tetrahedral than pure water. Our results demonstrate that the associated crossover length scale decreases with increasing temperature, suggesting that there is a fundamental connection between the spectroscopically observed crossover and that predicted to take place around idealized purely-repulsive solutes dissolved in water, although the water structure changes in the hydration-shells of alcohols are far smaller than those associated with an idealized ""dewetting"" transition.

Abstract: Azobenzene-based molecular photoswitches are becoming increasingly important for the development of photoresponsive, functional soft-matter material systems. Upon illumination with light, fast interconversion between a more stable trans- and a metastable cis configuration can be established resulting in pronounced changes in conformation, dipole moment or hydrophobicity. A rational design of functional photosensitive molecules with embedded azo moieties requires a thorough understanding of isomerization mechanisms and rates, especially the thermally activated relaxation. For small azo derivatives considered in the gas phase or simple solvents, Eyring's classical Transition State Theory (TST) approach yields useful predictions for trends in activation energies or corresponding half-life times of the cis isomer. However, TST or improved theories cannot easily be applied when the azo moiety is part of a larger molecular complex or embedded into a heterogeneous environment, where a multitude of possible reaction pathways may exist. In these cases, only the sampling of an ensemble of dynamic reactive trajectories (transition path sampling, TPS) with explicit models of the environment may reveal the nature of the processes involved. In the present work we show how a TPS approach can conveniently be implemented for the phenomenon of relaxation-isomerization of azobenzenes starting with the simple examples of pure azobenzene and a push-pull derivative immersed in a polar (DMSO) and apolar (toluene) solvent. The latter are represented explicitly at a molecular mechanical (MM) and the azo moiety at a quantum mechanical (QM) level. We demonstrate for the push-pull azobenze that path sampling in combination with the chosen QM/MM scheme produces the expected change in isomerization pathway from inversion to rotation in going from a low- to a high permittivity (explicit) solvent model. We discuss the potential of the simulation procedure presented for comparative calculation of reaction rates and an improved understanding of activated states.

Abstract
This paper will describe a formalism for using correlation functions between different grid cells as the basis for determining coarse-grained hydrodynamic equations for modeling the behavior of mesoscopic fluid systems. Configurations from a molecular dynamics simulation or other atomistic simulation are projected onto basis functions representing grid cells in a continuum hydrodynamic simulation. Equilibrium correlation functions between different grid cells are evaluated from the molecular simulation and used to determine the evolution operator for the coarse-grained hydrodynamic system. The formalism is demonstrated on a discrete particle simulation of diffusion with a spatially dependent diffusion coefficient. Correlation functions are calculated from the particle simulation and the spatially varying diffusion coefficient is recovered using a fitting procedure.","Escape rate for nonequilibrium processes dominated by strong non-detailed balance force

Abstract
Quantifying the escape rate from a meta-stable state is essential to understand a wide range of dynamical processes. Kramers’ classical rate formula is the product of an exponential function of the potential barrier height and a pre-factor related to the friction coefficient. Although many applications of the rate formula focused on the exponential term, the prefactor can have a significant effect on the escape rate in certain parameter regions, such as the overdamped limit and the underdamped limit. There have been continuous interests to understand the effect of non-detailed balance on the escape rate; however, how the prefactor behaves under strong non-detailed balance force remains elusive. In this work, we find that the escape rate formula has a vanishing prefactor with decreasing friction strength under the strong non-detailed balance limit. We both obtain analytical solutions in specific examples and provide a derivation for more general cases. We further verify the result by simulations and propose a testable experimental system of a charged Brownian particle in electromagnetic field. Our study demonstrates that a special care is required to estimate the effect of prefactor on the escape rate when non-detailed balance force dominates.

Abstract: We study, using Monte Carlo simulations, the density profiles and differential capacitance of ionic liquids confined by metal electrodes. To compute the electrostatic energy, we use the recently developed approach based on periodic Green's functions. The method also allows us to easily calculate the induced charge on the electrodes permitting an efficient implementation of simulations in a constant electrostatic potential ensemble. To speed up the simulations further, we model the ionic liquid as a lattice Coulomb gas and precalculate the interaction potential between the ions. We show that the lattice model captures the transition between camel-shaped and bell-shaped capacitance curves-the latter characteristic of ionic liquids (strong coupling limit) and the former of electrolytes (weak coupling). We observe the appearance of a second peak in the differential capacitance at ≈0.5 V for 2:1 ionic liquids, as the packing fraction is increased. Finally, we show that ionic size asymmetry decreases substantially the capacitance maximum, when all other parameters are kept fixed.

"Stochastic Model of Vesicular Sorting in Cellular Organelles
Quentin Vagne and Pierre Sens
Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 058102 – Published 1 February 2018
Abstract
The proper sorting of membrane components by regulated exchange between cellular organelles is crucial to intracellular organization. This process relies on the budding and fusion of transport vesicles, and should be strongly influenced by stochastic fluctuations, considering the relatively small size of many organelles. We identify the perfect sorting of two membrane components initially mixed in a single compartment as a first passage process, and we show that the mean sorting time exhibits two distinct regimes as a function of the ratio of vesicle fusion to budding rates. Low ratio values lead to fast sorting but result in a broad size distribution of sorted compartments dominated by small entities. High ratio values result in two well-defined sorted compartments but sorting is exponentially slow. Our results suggest an optimal balance between vesicle budding and fusion for the rapid and efficient sorting of membrane components and highlight the importance of stochastic effects for the steady-state organization of intracellular compartments.

The development of computational efficient models is essential to obtain a detailed characterization of the mechanisms underlying the folding of proteins and the formation of amyloid fibrils. Structure based computational models (Go-model) with Cα or all-atom resolutions have been able to successfully delineate the mechanisms of folding of several globular proteins and offer an interesting alternative to computationally intensive simulations with explicit solvent description. We are exploring here the limits of Go-model predictions by analyzing the folding of the non-globular repeat domain proteins Notch Ankyrin and p16INK4 and the formation of human islet polypeptide (hIAPP) fibrils. Folding trajectories of the repeat domain proteins revealed that an all-atom resolution is required to capture the folding pathways and cooperativity reported in experimental studies. The all-atom Go-model was also successful in predicting the free energy landscape of hIAPP fibrillation, suggesting a “dock and lock” mechanism of fibril elongation. We finally explored how mutations can affect the co-assembly of hIAPP fibrils by simulating a heterogeneous system composed of wildtype and mutated hIAPP peptides. Overall, this study shows that all-atom Go-model based simulations have the potential of discerning the effects of mutations and post-translational modifications in protein folding and association and may help in resolving the dichotomy between experimental and theoretical studies on protein folding and amyloid fibrillation.","Nanoscale hydrodynamics near solids

Abstract
Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a successful and well-established theory for the study of the structure of simple and complex fluids at equilibrium. The theory has been generalized to dynamical situations when the underlying dynamics is diffusive as in, for example, colloidal systems. However, there is no such a clear foundation for Dynamic DFT (DDFT) for the case of simple fluids in contact with solid walls. In this work, we derive DDFT for simple fluids by including not only the mass density field but also the momentum density field of the fluid. The standard projection operator method based on the Kawasaki-Gunton operator is used for deriving the equations for the average value of these fields. The solid is described as featureless under the assumption that all the internal degrees of freedom of the solid relax much faster than those of the fluid (solid elasticity is irrelevant). The fluid moves according to a set of non-local hydrodynamic equations that include explicitly the forces due to the solid. These forces are of two types, reversible forces emerging from the free energy density functional, and accounting for impenetrability of the solid, and irreversible forces that involve the velocity of both the fluid and the solid. These forces are localized in the vicinity of the solid surface. The resulting hydrodynamic equations should allow one to study dynamical regimes of simple fluids in contact with solid objects in isothermal situations.

Abstract: As a significant stimulus, the external electric field (EEF) can change the
decomposition mechanism and energy release of energetic materials (EMs). Hence,
understanding the response of EMs to an EEF is greatly meaningful for their safe usage.
Herein, the structural arrangement, a crucial factor in the impact sensitivity and detonation
performance of EMs, under the EEF ranging from 0.0 to 0.5 V/Å was investigated via
molecular dynamics simulation. Nitromethane (NM) was taken as a case study due to the
simple structure. The simulation results show that there exists a critical EEF strength
between 0.2 and 0.3 V/Å, which can induce the transition of NM molecules from relatively
disordered distribution to solidlike ordered and compacted arrangement with a large density.
In this ordered structure, NM dipoles are aligned in a head-to-tail pattern parallel to the EEF
direction because of the favored dipole−dipole interactions and weak C−H···O hydrogen
bonds. As the EEF strength is enhanced, the potential energy and cohesive energy density of
the NM system gradually decrease and increase, respectively, indicative of high thermodynamics stability of ordered arrangement. The results reported here also shed light on the potential of the EEF to induce the nucleation and crystallization to explore new polymorphs of EMs.

We perform ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation of liquid water in the canonical ensemble at ambient conditions using the SCAN meta-GGA functional approximation, and carry out systematic comparisons with the results obtained from the GGA-level PBE functional, and Tkatchenko-Scheffler van der Waals (vdW) dispersion correction inclusive PBE functional. We analyze various properties of liquid water including radial distribution functions, oxygen-oxygen-oxygen triplet angular distribution, tetrahedrality, hydrogen bonds, diffusion coefficients, ring statistics, density of states, band gaps, and dipole moments. We find that the SCAN functional is generally more accurate than the other two functionals for liquid water by not only capturing the intermediate-range vdW interactions but also mitigating the overly strong hydrogen bonds prescribed in PBE simulations. We also compare the results of SCAN-based AIMD simulations in the canonical and isothermal-isobaric ensembles. Our results suggest that SCAN provides a reliable description for most structural, electronic, and dynamical properties in liquid water.

An implicit-solvent coarse-grained model for poly(ethylene glycol)/poly(lactic acid) (PEG/PLA) diblock copolymer is derived using the iterative Boltzmann inversion technique. The model is shown to be effective in reproducing the micellar core-shell structure of PEG/PLA diblock copolymer recently reported in experiments. Influence of block architecture on the aggregate morphology is investigated. Upon increasing the length of PLA block, the model predicts a morphological change from conventional spherical to anisotropic (e.g., lamellar or cylindrical) structure, in agreement with experimental findings. The current model is also noted to provide very rapid aggregation of the block copolymers, allowing observation of copolymer micelles in their equilibrium structures in a short simulation time.

Abstract
Molecular dynamics simulations of interacting soft disks confined in a heterogeneous quenched matrix of soft obstacles show dynamics which is fundamentally different from that of hard disks. The interactions between the disks can enhance transport when their density is increased, as disks cooperatively help each other over the finite energy barriers in the matrix. The system exhibits a transition from a diffusive to a localized state, but the transition is strongly rounded. Effective exponents in the mean-squared displacement can be observed over three decades in time but depend on the density of the disks and do not correspond to asymptotic behavior in the vicinity of a critical point, thus, showing that it is incorrect to relate them to the critical exponents in the Lorentz model scenario. The soft interactions are, therefore, responsible for a breakdown of the universality of the dynamics.

A structural coarse-grained model for clays using simple iterative Boltzmann inversion

The Journal of Chemical Physics 148, 222809 (2018)
Karl Schaettle, Luis Ruiz Pestana, Teresa Head-Gordon, and Laura Nielsen Lammers

Cesium-137 is a major byproduct of nuclear energy generation and is environmentally threatening due to its long half-life and affinity for naturally occurring micaceous clays. Recent experimental observations of illite and phlogopite mica indicate that Cs+ is capable of exchanging with K+ bound in the anhydrous interlayers of layered silicates, forming sharp exchange fronts, leading to interstratification of Cs- and K-illite. We present here a coarse-grained (CG) model of the anhydrous illite interlayer developed using iterative Boltzmann inversion that qualitatively and quantitatively reproduces features of a previously proposed feedback mechanism of ion exchange. The CG model represents a 70-fold speedup over all-atom models of clay systems and predicts interlayer expansion for K-illite near ion exchange fronts. Contrary to the longstanding theory that ion exchange in a neighboring layer increases the binding of K in lattice counterion sites leading to interstratification, we find that the presence of neighboring exchanged layers leads to short-range structural relaxations that increase basal spacing and decrease cohesion of the neighboring K-illite layers. We also provide evidence that the formation of alternating Cs- and K-illite interlayers (i.e., ordered interstratification) is both thermodynamically and mechanically favorable compared to exchange in adjacent interlayers.",

Yuqing Zheng and Qiang Cui
J. Chem. Theory Comput., Just Accepted Manuscript
DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.7b01064
Abstract
The open/close transition in adenylate kinase (AK) is regarded as a representative example for large-scale conformational transition in proteins, yet its mechanism remains unclear despite numerous experimental and computational studies. Using extensive ($\sim$50 $\mu s$) explicit solvent atomistic simulations and Markov state analysis, we shed new lights on the mechanism of this transition in the apo form of AK. The closed basin of apo AK features an open NMP domain while the LID domain closes and rotates toward it. Therefore, although the computed structural properties of the closed ensemble are consistent with previously reported FRET and PRE measurements, our simulations suggest that NMP closure is likely to follow AMP binding, in contrast to the previous interpretation of FRET and PRE data that the apo state was able to sample the fully closed conformation for ``ligand selection"". The closed state ensemble is found to be kinetically heterogeneous; multiple pathways and timescales are associated with the open/close transition, providing new clues to the disparate time scales observed in different experiments. Besides inter-domain interactions, a novel mutual information analysis identifies specific intra-domain interactions that correlate strongly to transition kinetics, supporting observations from previous chimera experiments. While our results underscore the role of internal domain properties in determining the kinetics of open/close transition in apo AK, no evidence is observed for any significant degree of local unfolding during the transition. These observations about AK have general implications to our view of conformational states, transition pathways and timescales of conformational changes in proteins.

Abstract
The high interfacial tension between two immiscible liquids can provide the necessary driving force for the self-assembly of nanoparticles at the interface. Particularly, the interface between water and oily liquids (hydrocarbon chains) has been exploited to prepare networks of highly interconnected graphene sheets of only a few layers thick that are well suited for industrial applications. Studying such complex systems through particle-based simulations could greatly enhance the understanding of the various driving forces in action and could possibly give more control over the self-assembly process. However, the interaction potentials used in particle-based simulations are typically derived by reproducing bulk properties and are therefore not suitable to describe systems dominated by interfaces. To address this issue, we introduce a methodology to derive solid-liquid interaction potentials that yield an accurate representation of the balance between interfacial interactions at atomistic and coarse-grained resolutions. Our approach is validated through its ability to lead to the adsorption of graphene nanoflakes at the interface between water and n-hexane. The development of accurate coarse-grained potentials that our approach enables makes it possible to perform large scale simulations to study the assembly of graphene nanoparticles at the interface between immiscible liquids. Our methodology is illustrated through a simulation of many graphene nanoflakes adsorbing at the interface.
","Bounds on stochastic chemical kinetic systems at steady state

The Journal of Chemical Physics 148, 084106 (2018)

The method of moments has been proposed as a potential means to reduce the dimensionality of the chemical master equation (CME) appearing in stochastic chemical kinetics. However, attempts to apply the method of moments to the CME usually result in the so-called closure problem. Several authors have proposed moment closure schemes, which allow them to obtain approximations of quantities of interest, such as the mean molecular count for each species. However, these approximations have the dissatisfying feature that they come with no error bounds. This paper presents a fundamentally different approach to the closure problem in stochastic chemical kinetics. Instead of making an approximation to compute a single number for the quantity of interest, we calculate mathematically rigorous bounds on this quantity by solving semidefinite programs. These bounds provide a check on the validity of the moment closure approximations and are in some cases so tight that they effectively provide the desired quantity. In this paper, the bounded quantities of interest are the mean molecular count for each species, the variance in this count, and the probability that the count lies in an arbitrary interval. At present, we consider only steady-state probability distributions, intending to discuss the dynamic problem in a future publication.","Diffusion Monte Carlo approach versus adiabatic computation for local Hamiltonians

Phys. Rev. A 97, 022323 

Most research regarding quantum adiabatic optimization has focused on stoquastic Hamiltonians, whose ground states can be expressed with only real non-negative amplitudes and thus for whom destructive interference is not manifest. This raises the question of whether classical Monte Carlo algorithms can efficiently simulate quantum adiabatic optimization with stoquastic Hamiltonians. Recent results have given counterexamples in which path-integral and diffusion Monte Carlo fail to do so. However, most adiabatic optimization algorithms, such as for solving MAX-k-SAT problems, use k-local Hamiltonians, whereas our previous counterexample for diffusion Monte Carlo involved n-body interactions. Here we present a 6-local counterexample which demonstrates that even for these local Hamiltonians there are cases where diffusion Monte Carlo cannot efficiently simulate quantum adiabatic optimization. Furthermore, we perform empirical testing of diffusion Monte Carlo on a standard well-studied class of permutation-symmetric tunneling problems and similarly find large advantages for quantum optimization over diffusion Monte Carlo.",

Bottom-up coarse-grained models describe the intermolecular structure of all-atom (AA) models with desirable accuracy and efficiency. Unfortunately, structure-based models for liquids tend to dramatically overestimate the thermodynamic pressure and, consequently, tend to vaporize under ambient conditions. By employing a volume potential to introduce additional cohesion, self-consistent pressure-matching provides a simple and robust method for accurately reproducing the pressure equation of state (EoS) for homogeneous fluids, while still preserving an accurate description of intermolecular structure. Because they depend upon the global density, though, volume potentials cannot be directly employed for inhomogeneous systems, such as liquid-vapor interfaces. In the present work, we demonstrate that volume potentials can be readily adapted as potentials of the local density. The resulting local-density potentials provide an accurate description of the structure, pressure EoS, and local density fluctuations of an AA model for liquid methanol. Moreover, we demonstrate that very slight modifications to these local-density potentials allow for a quantitative description of either local or global density fluctuations. Most importantly, we demonstrate that the resulting potentials, which were parameterized to describe a homogeneous liquid, also generate stable liquid-vapor coexistence. However, further work is necessary to more accurately reproduce the interfacial density profile.","A minimum variance clustering approach produces robust and interpretable coarse-grained models

Markov state models (MSMs) are a powerful framework for the analysis of molecular dynamics datasets, such as protein folding simulations, due to their straightforward construction and statistical rigor. Coarse-graining MSMs into an interpretable number of macrostates is a crucial step for connecting theoretical results with experimental observables. Here, we present the minimum variance clustering approach (MVCA) for coarse-graining a MSM into a macrostate model. The method utilizes agglomerative clustering with Ward's minimum variance objective function, and the similarity of the microstate dynamics are determined using the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the corresponding rows in the MSM transition probability matrix. We first show that MVCA produces intuitive results for a simple tripeptide system, and is robust to long-duration statistical artifacts. MVCA is then applied to two protein folding simulations of the same protein in different force fields to demonstrate that a different number of macrostates is appropriate for each model, revealing a misfolded state present in only one of the simulations. Finally, we show that the same method can be used to analyze a dataset containing many MSMs from simulations in different force fields by aggregating them into groups and quantifying their dynamical similarity in the context of force field parameter choices. The minimum variance clustering approach with the Jensen-Shannon divergence provides a powerful tool to group dynamics by similarity, both among model states and among dynamical models themselves.","Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics Force-Field for Polyacrylamide in Infinite Dilution Derived from Iterative Boltzmann Inversion and MARTINI Force-Field

DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b09019
We present a mesoscale model of aqueous polyacrylamide in the infinitely dilute concentration regime, by combining an extant coarse-grained (CG) force-field, MARTINI, and the Iterative Boltzmann Inversion protocol (IBI). MARTINI force-field was used to retain the thermodynamics of solvation of the polymer in water, whereas the structural properties and intrapolymer interactions were optimized by IBI. Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of polymer in water were performed to benchmark the mesoscale simulations. Our results from the CG model show excellent agreement in structure with the atomistic system. We also studied the dynamical behavior of our CG system by computing the shear viscosity and compared it with the standard IBI model. The viscosity trends of our model were similar to the atomistic system, whereas the standard IBI model was highly dissimilar as expected. In summary, our hybrid CG model sufficiently mimics an infinitely dilute system, and is superior to both MARTINI and IBI in representing the structure and thermodynamics of the atomistic system, respectively. Our hybrid coarse-graining strategy promises applicability in large-scale simulations of polymeric/biological systems where the structure needs to be replicated accurately while preserving the thermodynamics of a smoother surrounding.

Abstract
HIV is a highly mutable virus, and over 30 years after its discovery, a vaccine or cure is still not available. The isolation of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) from HIV-infected patients has led to renewed hope for a prophylactic vaccine capable of combating the scourge of HIV. A major challenge is the design of immunogens and vaccination protocols that can elicit bnAbs that target regions of the virus’s spike proteins where the likelihood of mutational escape is low due to the high fitness cost of mutations. Related challenges include the choice of combinations of bnAbs for therapy. An accurate representation of viral fitness as a function of its protein sequences (a fitness landscape), with explicit accounting of the effects of coupling between mutations, could help address these challenges. We describe a computational approach that has allowed us to infer a fitness landscape for gp160, the HIV polyprotein that comprises the viral spike that is targeted by antibodies. We validate the inferred landscape through comparisons with experimental fitness measurements, and various other metrics. We show that an effective antibody that prevents immune escape must selectively bind to high escape cost residues that are surrounded by those where mutations incur a low fitness cost, motivating future applications of our landscape for immunogen design..

"Haataja, M.P. 2017. Lipid Domain Co-localization Induced by Membrane Undulations. Biophys. J. 112: 655–662.

Multicomponent lipid bilayer membranes display rich phase transition and associated compositional lipid domain formation behavior. When both leaflets of the bilayer contain domains, they are often found co-localized across the leaflets, implying the presence of a thermodynamic interleaflet coupling. In this work, it is demonstrated that fluctuation-induced interactions between domains embedded within opposing membrane leaflets provide a robust means to co-localize the domains. In particular, it is shown via a combination of a mode-counting argument, a perturbative calculation, and a non-perturbative treatment of a special case, that spatial variations in membrane bending rigidity associated with lipid domains embedded within the background phase always lead to an attractive interleaflet coupling with a magnitude of ∼0.01kBT/nm2 in simple model membrane systems. Finally, it is demonstrated that the fluctuation-induced coupling is very robust against membrane tension and substrate interactions.","Characterizing the switching transitions of an adsorbed peptide by mapping the potential energy surface

DOI:10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b10319

Peptide adsorption occurs across technology, medicine, and nature. The functions of adsorbed peptides are related to their conformation. In the past, molecular simulation methods such as molecular dynamics have been used to determine key conformations of adsorbed peptides. However, the transitions between these conformations often occur too slowly to be modeled reliably by such methods. This means such transitions are less well understood. In the study reported here, discrete path sampling is used for the first time to study the potential energy surface of an adsorbed peptide (polyalanine) and the transition pathways between various stable adsorbed conformations that have been identified in prior work by two of the authors [Mijajlovic, M.; Biggs, M. J. J. Phys. Chem. C 2007, 111, 15839−15847]. Mechanisms for the switching of adsorbed polyalanine between the stable conformations are elucidated along with the energetics of these switches.","Using the Maximum Entropy Principle to Combine Simulations and Solution Experiments

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations allow investigating the structural dynamics of biomolecular systems with unrivaled time and space resolution. However, in order to compensate for the inaccuracies of the utilized empirical force fields, it is becoming common to integrate MD simulations with experimental data obtained from ensemble measurements. We here review the approaches that can be used to combine MD and experiment under the guidance of the maximum entropy principle. We mostly focus on methods based on Lagrangian multipliers, either implemented as reweighting of existing simulations or through an on-the-fly optimization. We discuss how errors in the experimental data can be modeled and accounted for. Finally, we use simple model systems to illustrate the typical difficulties arising when applying these methods.

Abstract
Membraneless organelles important to intracellular compartmentalization have recently been shown to comprise assemblies of proteins which undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). However, many proteins involved in this phase separation are at least partially disordered. The molecular mechanism and the sequence determinants of this process are challenging to determine experimentally owing to the disordered nature of the assemblies, motivating the use of theoretical and simulation methods. This work advances a computational framework for conducting simulations of LLPS with residue-level detail, and allows for the determination of phase diagrams and coexistence densities of proteins in the two phases. The model includes a short-range contact potential as well as a simplified treatment of electrostatic energy. Interaction parameters are optimized against experimentally determined radius of gyration data for multiple unfolded or intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). These models are applied to two systems which undergo LLPS: the low complexity domain of the RNA-binding protein FUS and the DEAD-box helicase protein LAF-1. We develop a novel simulation method to determine thermodynamic phase diagrams as a function of the total protein concentration and temperature. We show that the model is capable of capturing qualitative changes in the phase diagram due to phosphomimetic mutations of FUS and to the presence or absence of the large folded domain in LAF-1. We also explore the effects of chain-length, or multivalency, on the phase diagram, and obtain results consistent with Flory-Huggins theory for polymers. Most importantly, the methodology presented here is flexible so that it can be easily extended to other pair potentials, be used with other enhanced sampling methods, and may incorporate additional features for biological systems of interest..",

Preferential solvation is a fundamental param- eter for the interpretation of solubility and solute structural stability. The molecular basis for solute−solvent interactions can be obtained through distribution functions, and the thermodynamic connection to experimental data depends on the computation of distribution integrals, specifically Kirkwood-Buff integrals for the determination of preferential interactions. Standard radial distribution functions, however, are not convenient for the study of the solvation of complex, nonspherical solutes, as proteins. Here we show that minimum-distance distribution functions can be used to compute KB integrals while at the same time providing an insightful view of solute−solvent interactions at the molecular level. We compute preferential solvation parameters for Ribonuclease T1 in aqueous solutions of urea and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) and show that, while macroscopic solvation shows that urea is preferentially bound to the protein surface and TMAO is preferentially excluded, both display specific density augmentations at the protein surface in dilute solutions. Therefore, direct protein-osmolyte interactions can play a role in the stability and activity of the protein even for preferentially hydrated systems. The generality of the distribution function and its natural connection to thermodynamic data suggest that it will be useful in general for the study of solvation in mixtures of structurally complex solutes and solvents.","The Predictive Power of Different Types of Experimental Restraints in Small Molecule Docking: A Review

Incorporating experimental restraints is a powerful method of increasing accuracy in computational protein small molecule docking simulations models. Different algorithms integrate distinct forms of biochemical data during the docking and/or scoring stages. These so-called hybrid methods make use of receptor-based information such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) restraints or small molecule-based information such as structure-activity relationships (SAR). A third class of methods directly interrogates contacts between the protein receptor and the small molecule. This work reviews the current state of using such restraints in docking simulations, evaluates their feasibility across broad systems, and identifies potential areas of algorithm development.

Understanding redox and photochemical reactions in aqueous environments requires a precise knowledge of the ionization potential and electron affinity of liquid water. The former has been measured, but not the latter. We predict the electron affinity of liquid water and of its surface from first principles, coupling path-integral molecular dynamics with ab initio potentials, and many-body perturbation theory. Our results for the surface (0.8 eV) agree well with recent pump-probe spectroscopy measurements on amorphous ice. Those for the bulk (0.1–0.3 eV) differ from several estimates adopted in the literature, which we critically revisit. We show that the ionization potential of the bulk and surface are almost identical; instead their electron affinities differ substantially, with the conduction band edge of the surface much deeper in energy than that of the bulk. We also discuss the significant impact of nuclear quantum effects on the fundamental gap and band edges of the liquid.

A fundamental challenge in materials design is linking building block attributes to crystal structure. Addressing this challenge is particularly difficult for systems that exhibit emergent order, such as entropy-stabilized colloidal crystals. We combine recently developed techniques in inverse design with machine learning to construct a model that correctly classifies the crystals of more than ten thousand polyhedral shapes into 13 different structures with a predictive accuracy of 96% using only two geometric shape measures. With three measures, 98% accuracy is achieved. We test our model on previously reported colloidal crystal structures for 71 symmetric polyhedra and obtain 92% accuracy. Our findings (1) demonstrate that entropic colloidal crystals are controlled by surprisingly few parameters, (2) provide a quantitative model to predict these crystals solely from the geometry of their building blocks, and (3) suggest a prediction paradigm that easily generalizes to other self-assembled materials.",

Motivated by the extremely high computing costs associated with estimates of free energies for biological systems using molecular simulations, we further the exploration of existing “belief propagation” (BP) algorithms for fixed-backbone peptide and protein systems. The precalculation of pairwise interactions among discretized libraries of side-chain conformations, along with representation of protein side chains as nodes in a graphical model, enables direct application of the BP approach, which requires only ∼1 s of single-processor run time after the precalculation stage. We use a “loopy BP” algorithm, which can be seen as an approximate generalization of the transfer-matrix approach to highly connected (i.e., loopy) graphs, and it has previously been applied to protein calculations. We examine the application of loopy BP to several peptides as well as the binding site of the T4 lysozyme L99A mutant. The present study reports on (i) the comparison of the approximate BP results with estimates from unbiased estimators based on the Amber99SB force field; (ii) investigation of the effects of varying library size on BP predictions; and (iii) a theoretical discussion of the discretization effects that can arise in BP calculations. The data suggest that, despite their approximate nature, BP free-energy estimates are highly accurateindeed, they never fall outside confidence intervals from unbiased estimators for the systems where independent results could be obtained. Furthermore, we find that libraries of sufficiently fine discretization (which diminish library-size sensitivity) can be obtained with standard computing resources in most cases. Altogether, the extremely low computing times and accurate results suggest the BP approach warrants further study","Identification of a ubiquitin-binding interface using Rosetta and DEER

ExoU is a type III-secreted cytotoxin expressing A2 phospholipase activity when injected into eukaryotic target cells by the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The enzymatic activity of ExoU is undetectable in vitro unless ubiquitin, a required cofactor, is added to the reaction. The role of ubiquitin in facilitating ExoU enzymatic activity is poorly understood but of significance for designing inhibitors to prevent tissue injury during infections with strains of P. aeruginosa producing this toxin. Most ubiquitin-binding proteins, including ExoU, demonstrate a low (micromolar) affinity for monoubiquitin (monoUb). Additionally, ExoU is a large and dynamic protein, limiting the applicability of traditional structural techniques such as NMR and X-ray crystallography to define this protein–protein interaction. Recent advancements in computational methods, however, have allowed high-resolution protein modeling using sparse data. In this study, we combine double electron–electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy and Rosetta modeling to identify potential binding interfaces of ExoU and monoUb. The lowest-energy scoring model was tested using biochemical, biophysical, and biological techniques. To verify the binding interface, Rosetta was used to design a panel of mutations to modulate binding, including one variant with enhanced binding affinity. Our analyses show the utility of computational modeling when combined with sensitive biological assays and biophysical approaches that are exquisitely suited for large dynamic proteins.

Abstract
Proton transfer via hydronium and hydroxide ions in water is ubiquitous. It underlies acid-base chemistry, certain enzyme reactions, and even infection by the flu. Despite two-centuries of investigation, the mechanism underlying why hydronium diffuses faster than hydroxide in water is still not well understood. Herein, we employ state of the art Density Functional Theory based molecular dynamics, with corrections for nonlocal van der Waals interactions, and self-interaction in the electronic ground state, to model water and the hydrated water ions. At this level of theory, structural diffusion of hydronium preserves the previously recognized concerted behavior. However, by contrast, proton transfer via hydroxide is dominated by stepwise events, arising from a stabilized hyper-coordination solvation structure that discourages proton transfer. Specifically, the latter exhibits non-planar geometry, which agrees with neutron scattering results. Asymmetry in the temporal correlation of proton transfer enables hydronium to diffuse faster than hydroxide",

EmrE is a bacterial transporter protein that forms an anti-parallel homodimer with four transmembrane helices in each monomer. EmrE transports positively charged aromatic compounds, such as TPP+ and its derivatives. We performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of EmrE in complex with TPP+, MeTPP+, and MBTPP+ embedded in a membrane. The detailed molecular properties and interactions were analysed for all EmrE-ligand complexes. Our MD results identified that Lys22, Tyr40, Phe44, Trp45, and Trp63 formed potential π interactions with all three ligands and further confirmed the essential role of Glu14. Moreover, distance analysis and structural changes in the EmrE translocation pathway suggest that ligand recognition and protein conformational changes depend on the structural properties of the substrate. Analysis of the movement of the ligand in the protein binding site and rotation of the ligand’s aromatic rings confirm that substrates with aromatic moieties, such as MBTPP+, exhibit relatively stable binding to EmrE. Interestingly, the aromatic rings of Tyr40, Phe44, Trp45, and Trp63 underwent parallel movements with the aromatic rings of TPP+. Based on the MD results, we propose that π interactions, as well as the mutual rotation of the aromatic rings in the protein and ligand, can be regarded as sources of ligand movement, and thus, the whole complex may work as a “molecular propeller”.","Enhanced configurational sampling with hybrid non-equilibrium molecular dynamics–Monte Carlo propagator

Molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories based on classical equations of motion can be used to sample the configurational space of complex molecular systems. However, brute-force MD often converges slowly due to the ruggedness of the underlying potential energy surface. Several schemes have been proposed to address this problem by effectively smoothing the potential energy surface. However, in order to recover the proper Boltzmann equilibrium probability distribution, these approaches must then rely on statistical reweighting techniques or generate the simulations within a Hamiltonian tempering replica-exchange scheme. The present work puts forth a novel hybrid sampling propagator combining Metropolis-Hastings Monte Carlo (MC) with proposed moves generated by non-equilibrium MD (neMD). This hybrid neMD-MC propagator comprises three elementary elements: (i) an atomic system is dynamically propagated for some period of time using standard equilibrium MD on the correct potential energy surface; (ii) the system is then propagated for a brief period of time during what is referred to as a “boosting phase,” via a time-dependent Hamiltonian that is evolved toward the perturbed potential energy surface and then back to the correct potential energy surface; (iii) the resulting configuration at the end of the neMD trajectory is then accepted or rejected according to a Metropolis criterion before returning to step 1. A symmetric two-end momentum reversal prescription is used at the end of the neMD trajectories to guarantee that the hybrid neMD-MC sampling propagator obeys microscopic detailed balance and rigorously yields the equilibrium Boltzmann distribution. The hybrid neMD-MC sampling propagator is designed and implemented to enhance the sampling by relying on the accelerated MD and solute tempering schemes. It is also combined with the adaptive biased force sampling algorithm to examine. Illustrative tests with specific biomolecular systems indicate that the method can yield a significant speedup.","Markov State Models: From an Art to a Science. Brooke E Husic and Vijay S. Pande.

Markov state models (MSMs) are a powerful framework for analyzing dynamical systems, such as molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, that have gained widespread use over the past several decades. This review offers a complete picture of the MSM field to date, presented for a general audience as a timeline of key developments in the field. We sequentially address early studies that motivated the method, canonical papers that established the use of MSMs for MD analysis, and subsequent advances in software and analysis protocols. The derivation of a variational principle for MSMs in 2013 signified a turning point from expertise-driving MSM building to a systematic, objective protocol. The variational approach, combined with best practices for model selection and open-source software, enabled a wide range of MSM analysis for applications such as protein folding and allostery, ligand binding, and protein-protein association. To conclude, the current frontiers of methods development are highlighted, as well as exciting applications in experimental design and drug discovery.","5.

Abstract
We present an ab initio parameterization scheme for explicitly dipole-polarizable force fields for simulation of molecular liquids. The scheme allows for, in principle, arbitrarily coarse-grained representations. All parameters in the force field are derived from first principles, based on simple physical arguments. Only one fit parameter enters the parameterization, a global scaling factor for the size of the particles, which is adjusted to reproduce the experimental mass density. As important examples and for the first time, polarizable coarse-grained force fields are derived for 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium cations with varying alkyl-chain lengths (alkyl=ethyl,butyl,hexyl), and hexafluorophosphate and tetrafluoroborate anions. Our findings are in good agreement with experimental results and results of further atomistic simulations. Hence, the force fields can be faithfully used where polarizability is expected to play a significant role, such as simulations of energy storage devices.",

We present Tinker-HP, a massively MPI parallel package dedicated to classical molecular dynamics (MD) and to multiscale simulations, using advanced polarizable force fields (PFF) encompassing distributed multipoles electrostatics. Tinker-HP is an evolution of the popular Tinker package code that conserves its simplicity of use and its reference double precision implementation for CPUs. Grounded on interdisciplinary efforts with applied mathematics, Tinker-HP allows for long polarizable MD simulations on large systems up to millions of atoms. We detail in the paper the newly developed extension of massively parallel 3D spatial decomposition to point dipole polarizable models as well as their coupling to efficient Krylov iterative and non-iterative polarization solvers. The design of the code allows the use of various computer systems ranging from laboratory workstations to modern petascale supercomputers with thousands of cores. Tinker-HP proposes therefore the first high-performance scalable CPU computing environment for the development of next generation point dipole PFFs and for production simulations. Strategies linking Tinker-HP to Quantum Mechanics (QM) in the framework of multiscale polarizable self-consistent QM/MD simulations are also provided. The possibilities, performances and scalability of the software are demonstrated via benchmarks calculations using the polarizable AMOEBA force field on systems ranging from large water boxes of increasing size and ionic liquids to (very) large biosystems encompassing several proteins as well as the complete satellite tobacco mosaic virus and ribosome structures. For small systems, Tinker-HP appears to be competitive with the Tinker-OpenMM GPU implementation of Tinker. As the system size grows, Tinker-HP remains operational thanks to its access to distributed memory and takes advantage of its new algorithmic enabling for stable long timescale polarizable simulations. Overall, a several thousand-fold acceleration over a single-core computation is observed for the largest systems. The extension of the present CPU implementation of Tinker-HP to other computational platforms is discussed.","Efficient evaluation of atom tunneling combined with electronic structure calculations

Methodology for finding optimal tunneling paths and evaluating tunneling rates for atomic rearrangements is described. First, an optimal JWKB tunneling path for a system with fixed energy is obtained using a line integral extension of the nudged elastic band method. Then, a calculation of the dynamics along the path is used to determine the temperature at which it corresponds to an optimal Feynman path for thermally activated tunneling (instanton) and a harmonic approximation is used to estimate the transition rate. The method is illustrated with calculations for a modified two-dimensional Müller-Brown surface but is efficient enough to be used in combination with electronic structure calculations of the energy and atomic forces in systems containing many atoms. An example is presented where tunneling is the dominant mechanism well above room temperature as an H3BNH3 molecule dissociates to form H2. Also, a solid-state example is presented where density functional theory calculations of H atom tunneling in a Ta crystal give close agreement with experimental measurements on hydrogen diffusion over a wide range in temperature.","Computational modeling of three-dimensional ECM-rigidity sensing to guide directed cell migration.

Filopodia have a key role in sensing both chemical and mechanical cues in surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM). However, quantitative understanding is still missing in the filopodial mechanosensing of local ECM stiffness, resulting from dynamic interactions between filopodia and the surrounding 3D ECM fibers. Here we present a method for characterizing the stiffness of ECM that is sensed by filopodia based on the theory of elasticity and discrete ECM fiber. We have applied this method to a filopodial mechanosensing model for predicting directed cell migration toward stiffer ECM. This model provides us with a distribution of force and displacement as well as their time rate of changes near the tip of a filopodium when it is bound to the surrounding ECM fibers. Aggregating these effects in each local region of 3D ECM, we express the local ECM stiffness sensed by the cell and explain polarity in the cellular durotaxis mechanism.","6.

Abstract
Molecular simulation has emerged as an essential tool for modern-day research, but obtaining proper results and making reliable conclusions from simulations requires adequate sampling of the system under consideration. To this end, a variety of methods exist in the literature that can enhance sampling considerably, and increasingly sophisticated, effective algorithms continue to be developed at a rapid pace. Implementation of these techniques, however, can be challenging for experts and non-experts alike. There is a clear need for software that provides rapid, reliable, and easy access to a wide range of advanced sampling methods and that facilitates implementation of new techniques as they emerge. Here we present SSAGES, a publicly available Software Suite for Advanced General Ensemble Simulations designed to interface with multiple widely used molecular dynamics simulations packages. SSAGES allows facile application of a variety of enhanced sampling techniques—including adaptive biasing force, string methods, and forward flux sampling—that extract meaningful free energy and transition path data from all-atom and coarse-grained simulations. A noteworthy feature of SSAGES is a user-friendly framework that facilitates further development and implementation of new methods and collective variables. In this work, the use of SSAGES is illustrated in the context of simple representative applications involving distinct methods and different collective variables that are available in the current release of the suite.

"RESPEC Incorporates Residue Specificity and Ligand Effect into Elastic Network Model
Burak T Kaynak, Doga Findik, and Pemra Doruker
J. Phys. Chem. B, Just Accepted Manuscript (2017) doi: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b10325
RESPEC is a new framework that introduces residue specificity into elastic network modeling (ENM) to successfully render intact protein-ligand complexes as well as apo proteins. This framework establishes a broader application of coarse-graining idea via describing: (i) a coarse-grained residue/node through its heavy atoms as virtual nodes, (ii) an effective B-factor for such a node, directly obtained from the experimental data, and (iii) a node-node interaction by a cumulative distance-dependent force constant. RESPEC improves the level of correlations with B-factors after optimizing the parameters of the model. In the absence of ligands, the mean correlations excel 0.72, which is higher than the classical ENM results, based on a diverse set of proteins. Global modes satisfactorily describe the conformational transitions for apo structures. When the ligands are included at atomistic resolution in RESPEC calculations, mean correlation values exceed 0.9 over the same dataset.
","Approximating Matsubara dynamics using the planetary model: Tests on liquid water and ice

The Journal of Chemical Physics 148, 102336 (2018); 
Michael J. Willatt, Michele Ceriotti, and Stuart C. Althorpe

Matsubara dynamics is the quantum-Boltzmann-conserving classical dynamics which remains when real-time coherences are taken out of the exact quantum Liouvillian [T. J. H. Hele et al., J. Chem. Phys. 142, 134103 (2015)]; because of a phase-term, it cannot be used as a practical method without further approximation. Recently, Smith et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 142, 244112 (2015)] developed a “planetary” model dynamics which conserves the Feynman-Kleinert (FK) approximation to the quantum-Boltzmann distribution. Here, we show that for moderately anharmonic potentials, the planetary dynamics gives a good approximation to Matsubara trajectories on the FK potential surface by decoupling the centroid trajectory from the locally harmonic Matsubara fluctuations, which reduce to a single phase-less fluctuation particle (the “planet”). We also show that the FK effective frequency can be approximated by a direct integral over these fluctuations, obviating the need to solve iterative equations. This modification, together with use of thermostatted ring-polymer molecular dynamics, allows us to test the planetary model on water (gas-phase, liquid, and ice) using the q-TIP4P/F potential surface. The “planetary” fluctuations give a poor approximation to the rotational/librational bands in the infrared spectrum, but a good approximation to the bend and stretch bands, where the fluctuation lineshape is found to be motionally narrowed by the vibrations of the centroid.","Metadynamics Enhanced Markov Modeling of Protein Dynamics. Mithun Biswas, Benjamin Lickert, and Gerhard Stock. The Journal of Physical Chemistry B Just Accepted Manuscript. DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b11800 

Enhanced sampling techniques represent a versatile approach to account for rare conformational transitions in biomolecules. A particularly promising strategy is to combine massive parallel computing of short molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories (to sample the free energy landscape of the system) with Markov state modeling (to rebuild the kinetics from the sampled data). To obtain well-distributed initial structures for the short trajectories, it is proposed to employ Metadynamics MD, which quickly sweeps through the entire free energy landscape of interest. Being only used to generate initial conformations, the implementation of Metadynamics can be simple and fast. The conformational dynamics of helical peptide Aib9 is adopted to discuss various technical issues of the approach, including Metadynamics settings, minimal number and length of short MD trajectories, as well as the validation of the resulting Markov models. Using Metadynamics to launch some thousands of nanosecond trajectories, several Markov state models are constructed which reveal that previous unbiased MD simulations of in total 16 μs length cannot provide correct equilibrium populations or qualitative features of the pathway distribution of the short peptide.",,
"Characterizing Conformational Dynamics of Proteins Using Evolutionary Couplings
Jiangyan Feng and Diwakar Shukla
J. Phys. Chem. B, Just Accepted Manuscript (2018) doi: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b07529
Conformational dynamics are essential for protein functions. Traditionally, reaction coordinates have been used to interpret the complex dynamics of proteins once the sufficient sampling in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is available. Here, we evaluate the power of evolutionary couplings (ECs) to capture protein dynamics and therefore infer reaction coordinates a priori, which can properly guide the sampling and efficiently calculate free energy landscape. We analyze ten diverse proteins and show that few ECs are sufficient to characterize conformational dynamics of proteins involved in folding process and conformational changes. Functional ECs and structural ECs are also distinguished based on the distances. With the rapid strides in sequencing technology, we expect that ECs will help identify reaction coordinates and enhance the sampling of the slow dynamical process associated with protein folding and conformational changes.
","Coarse-grained model of nanoscale segregation, water diffusion, and proton transport in Nafion membranes
Aleksey Vishnyakov, Runfang Mao, Ming-Tsung Lee, and Alexander V. Neimark The Journal of Chemical Physics 148, 024108 (2018); https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4997401

We present a coarse-grained model of the acid form of Nafion membrane that explicitly includes proton transport. This model is based on a soft-core bead representation of the polymer implemented into the dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulation framework. The proton is introduced as a separate charged bead that forms dissociable Morse bonds with water beads. Morse bond formation and breakup artificially mimics the Grotthuss hopping mechanism of proton transport. The proposed DPD model is parameterized to account for the specifics of the conformations and flexibility of the Nafion backbone and sidechains; it treats electrostatic interactions in the smeared charge approximation. The simulation results qualitatively, and in many respects quantitatively, predict the specifics of nanoscale segregation in the hydrated Nafion membrane into hydrophobic and hydrophilic subphases, water diffusion, and proton mobility. As the hydration level increases, the hydrophilic subphase exhibits a percolation transition from a collection of isolated water clusters to a 3D network of pores filled with water embedded in the hydrophobic matrix. The segregated morphology is characterized in terms of the pore size distribution with the average size growing with hydration from ∼1 to ∼4 nm. Comparison of the predicted water diffusivity with the experimental data taken from different sources shows good agreement at high and moderate hydration and substantial deviation at low hydration, around and below the percolation threshold. This discrepancy is attributed to the dynamic percolation effects of formation and rupture of merging bridges between the water clusters, which become progressively important at low hydration, when the coarse-grained model is unable to mimic the fine structure of water network that includes singe molecule bridges. Selected simulations of water diffusion are performed for the alkali metal substituted membrane which demonstrate the effects of the counter-ions on membrane self-assembly and transport. The hydration dependence of the proton diffusivity reproduces semi-qualitatively the trend of the diverse experimental data, showing a sharp decrease around the percolation threshold. Overall, the proposed model opens up an opportunity to study self-assembly and water and proton transport in polyelectrolytes using computationally efficient DPD simulations, and, with further refinement, it may become a practical tool for theory informed design and optimization of perm-selective and ion-conducting membranes with improved properties.
","Transport-Relevant Protein Conformational Dynamics and Water Dynamics on Multiple Timescales in an Archetypal Proton Channel - Insights from Solid-State NMR
Venkata Mandala, Martin D. Gelenter, and Mei Hong
Journal of the American Chemical Society Just Accepted Manuscript
DOI: 10.1021/jacs.7b12464
The influenza M2 protein forms a tetrameric proton channel that conducts protons from the acidic endosome into the virion by shuttling protons between water and a transmembrane histidine. Previous NMR studies have shown that this histidine protonates and deprotonates on the microsecond timescale. However, M2’s proton conduction rate is 10 – 1000 s-1, more than two orders of magnitude slower than the histidine-water proton-exchange rate. M2 is also known to be conformationally plastic. To address the disparity between the functional timescale and the timescales of protein conformational dynamics and water dynamics, we have now investigated a W41F mutant of the M2 transmembrane domain using solid-state NMR. 13C chemical shifts of the membrane-bound peptide indicate the presence of two distinct tetramer conformations, whose concentrations depend exclusively on pH and hence the charge-state distribution of the tetramers. High-temperature 2D correlation spectra indicate that these two conformations interconvert at a rate of ~400 s-1 when the +2 and +3 charge states dominate, which gives the first experimental evidence of protein conformational motion on the transport timescale. Protein 13C-detected water 1H T2 relaxation measurements show that channel water relaxes an order of magnitude faster than bulk water and membrane-associated water, indicating that channel water undergoes nanosecond motion in a pH-independent fashion. These results connect motions on three timescales to explain M2’s proton-conduction mechanism: picosecond-to-nanosecond motions of water molecules facilitate proton Grotthuss hopping, microsecond motions of the histidine sidechain allow water-histidine proton transfer, while millisecond motions of the entire four-helix bundle constitute the rate-limiting step, dictating the number of protons released into the virion.","Characterizing protein conformations by correlation analysis of coarse-grained contact matrices

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5004141

We have developed a method to capture the essential conformational dynamics of folded biopolymers using statistical analysis of coarse-grained segment-segment contacts. Previously, the residue-residue contact analysis of simulation trajectories was successfully applied to the detection of conformational switching motions in biomolecular complexes. However, the application to large protein systems (larger than 1000 amino acid residues) is challenging using the description of residue contacts. Also, the residue-based method cannot be used to compare proteins with different sequences. To expand the scope of the method, we have tested several coarse-graining schemes that group a collection of consecutive residues into a segment. The definition of these segments may be derived from structural and sequence information, while the interaction strength of the coarse-grained segment-segment contacts is a function of the residue-residue contacts. We then perform covariance calculations on these coarse-grained contact matrices. We monitored how well the principal components of the contact matrices is preserved using various rendering functions. The new method was demonstrated to assist the reduction of the degrees of freedom for describing the conformation space, and it potentially allows for the analysis of a system that is approximately tenfold larger compared with the corresponding residue contact-based method. This method can also render a family of similar proteins into the same conformational space, and thus can be used to compare the structures of proteins with different sequences.",
"VAMPnets for deep learning of molecular kinetics
Andreas Mardt, Luca Pasquali, Hao Wu and Frank Noé
Nature Communications 9, (2018) doi: 10.1038/s41467-017-02388-1
There is an increasing demand for computing the relevant structures, equilibria, and long-timescale kinetics of biomolecular processes, such as protein-drug binding, from high-throughput molecular dynamics simulations. Current methods employ transformation of simulated coordinates into structural features, dimension reduction, clustering the dimension-reduced data, and estimation of a Markov state model or related model of the interconversion rates between molecular structures. This handcrafted approach demands a substantial amount of modeling expertise, as poor decisions at any step will lead to large modeling errors. Here we employ the variational approach for Markov processes (VAMP) to develop a deep learning framework for molecular kinetics using neural networks, dubbed VAMPnets. A VAMPnet encodes the entire mapping from molecular coordinates to Markov states, thus combining the whole data processing pipeline in a single end-to-end framework. Our method performs equally or better than state-of-the-art Markov modeling methods and provides easily interpretable few-state kinetic models.
","Molecular dynamics based enhanced sampling of collective variables with very large time steps
Pei-Yang Chen, and Mark E. Tuckerman The Journal of Chemical Physics 148, 024106 (2018); https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4999447

Enhanced sampling techniques that target a set of collective variables and that use molecular dynamics as the driving engine have seen widespread application in the computational molecular sciences as a means to explore the free-energy landscapes of complex systems. The use of molecular dynamics as the fundamental driver of the sampling requires the introduction of a time step whose magnitude is limited by the fastest motions in a system. While standard multiple time-stepping methods allow larger time steps to be employed for the slower and computationally more expensive forces, the maximum achievable increase in time step is limited by resonance phenomena, which inextricably couple fast and slow motions. Recently, we introduced deterministic and stochastic resonance-free multiple time step algorithms for molecular dynamics that solve this resonance problem and allow ten- to twenty-fold gains in the large time step compared to standard multiple time step algorithms [P. Minary et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 150201 (2004); B. Leimkuhler et al., Mol. Phys. 111, 3579–3594 (2013)]. These methods are based on the imposition of isokinetic constraints that couple the physical system to Nosé-Hoover chains or Nosé-Hoover Langevin schemes. In this paper, we show how to adapt these methods for collective variable-based enhanced sampling techniques, specifically adiabatic free-energy dynamics/temperature-accelerated molecular dynamics, unified free-energy dynamics, and by extension, metadynamics, thus allowing simulations employing these methods to employ similarly very large time steps. The combination of resonance-free multiple time step integrators with free-energy-based enhanced sampling significantly improves the efficiency of conformational exploration.

Free-Energy Analysis of Peptide Binding in Lipid Membrane Using All-Atom Molecular Dynamics Simulation Combined with Theory of Solutions
Tomoko Mizuguchi and Nobuyuki Matubayasi
The Journal of Physical Chemistry B Article ASAP
DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b08241
All-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are performed to examine the stabilities of a variety of binding configurations of alamethicin, a 20-amino-acid amphipathic peptide, in the bilayers of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC) and 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DMPC). The binding free energy of alamethicin is calculated through a combination of MD simulation and the energy-representation theory of solutions, and it is seen that the transmembrane configuration is stable in both membranes. A surface-bound state is also found to be stable due to the balance between the attractive and repulsive interactions of the peptide with lipid and water, and the key role of water is pointed out for the stability in the interfacial region. A difference between the POPC and DMPC systems is noted when the polar C-terminal domain is buried in the hydrophobic region of the membrane. In POPC, the peptide is unfavorably located with that configuration due to the loss of electrostatic interaction between the peptide and lipid.

","Computing curvature sensitivity of biomolecules in membranes by simulated buckling
Federico Elias-Wolff, Martin Lindén, Alexander P. Lyubartsev, and Erik G Brandt
DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00878

Membrane curvature sensing, where the binding free energies of membrane-associated molecules depend on the local membrane curvature, is a key factor to modulate and maintain the shape and organization of cell membranes. However, the microscopic mechanisms are not well understood, partly due to absence of efficient simulation methods. Here, we describe a method to compute the curvature dependence of the binding free energy of a membrane-associated probe molecule that interacts with a buckled membrane, which has been created by lateral compression of a flat bilayer patch. This buckling approach samples a wide range of curvatures in a single simulation, and anisotropic effects can be extracted from the orientation statistics. We develop an efficient and robust algorithm to extract the motion of the probe along the buckled membrane surface, and evaluate its numerical properties by extensive sampling of three coarse-grained model systems: local lipid density in a curved environment for single-component bilayers, curvature preferences of individual lipids in two-component membranes, and curvature sensing by a homo-trimeric transmembrane protein. The method can be used to complement experimental data from curvature partition assays, and provides additional insight into mesoscopic theories and molecular mechanisms for curvature sensing.

Abstract: We review here Maximum Caliber (Max Cal), a general variational principle for inferring distributions of paths in dynamical processes and networks. Max Cal is to dynamical trajectories what the principle of maximum entropy is to equilibrium states or stationary populations. In Max Cal, you maximize a path entropy over all possible pathways, subject to dynamical constraints, in order to predict relative path weights. Many well-known relationships of non-equilibrium statistical physics—such as the Green-Kubo fluctuation-dissipation relations, Onsager’s reciprocal relations, and Prigogine’s minimum entropy production—are limited to near-equilibrium processes. Max Cal is more general. While it can readily derive these results under those limits, Max Cal is also applicable far from equilibrium. We give examples of Max Cal as a method of inference about trajectory distributions from limited data, finding reaction coordinates in bio-molecular simulations, and modeling the complex dynamics of non-thermal systems such as gene regulatory networks or the collective firing of neurons. We also survey its basis in principle and some limitations","ART-RRT: As-Rigid-As-Possible exploration of ligand unbinding pathways

This article proposes a method to efficiently generate approximate ligand unbinding pathways. It combines an efficient tree-based exploration method with a morphing technique from Computer Graphics for dimensionality reduction. This method is computationally cheap and, unlike many existing approaches, does not require a reaction coordinate to guide the search. It can be used for finding pathways with known or unknown directions beforehand. The approach is evaluated on several benchmarks and the obtained solutions are compared with the results from other state-of-the-art approaches. We show that the method is time-efficient and produces pathways in good agreement with other state-of-the-art solutions. These paths can serve as first approximations that can be used, analyzed, or improved with more specialized methods.

DOI: 10.1021/jacs.7b12045

We demonstrate that lipidomics coupled with molecular dynamics reveals unique phospholipase A2 specificity toward membrane phospholipid substrates. We discovered unexpected head-group and acyl-chain specificity for three-major human phospholipases A2. These differences between each enzyme’s specificity coupled with molecular dynamics based structural and binding studies revealed unique active site and interfacial surface binding moieties for each enzyme that explains the observed specificity at a hitherto inaccessible structural level. Surprisingly, we discovered that a unique hydrophobic binding site for the cleaved fatty acid dominates each enzyme’s specificity, rather than its catalytic residues and polar head-group binding site. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed the optimal phospholipid binding mode leading to a detailed understanding of the preference of cytosolic phospholipase A2 for cleavage of pro-inflammatory arachidonic acid, calcium-independent phospholipase A2 which is involved in membrane remodeling for cleavage of linoleic acid, and for anti-bacterial secreted phospholipase A2 favoring linoleate, saturated fatty acids, and phosphatidylglycerol.

"Nonadiabatic Dynamics via the Symmetrical Quasi-Classical Method in the Presence of Anharmonicity 

Alexei A. Kananenka, Chang-Yu Hsieh, Jianshu Cao, and Eitan Geva

J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2018, 9, 319−326

Abstract:The symmetrical quasi-classical (SQC) method recently proposed by Miller and Cotton allows one to simulate nonadiabatic dynamics based on an algorithm with classical-like scaling with respect to system size. This is made possible by casting the electronic degrees of freedom in terms of mapping variables that can be propagated in a classical-like manner. While SQC was shown to be rather accurate when applied to benchmark models with harmonic electronic potential energy surfaces, it was also found to become inaccurate and to suffer numerical instabilities when applied to anharmonic systems. In this paper, we propose an extended SQC (E-SQC) methodology for overcoming those discrepancies by describing the anharmonic nuclear modes, which are coupled to the electronic degrees of freedom, in terms of classical-like mapping variables. The accuracy of E-SQC relative to standard SQC is demonstrated on benchmark models with quartic and Morse potential energy surfaces.

The function of RNA molecules usually depends on their overall fold and on the presence of specific structural motifs. Chemical probing methods are routinely used in combination with nearest-neighbor models to determine RNA secondary structure. Among the available methods, SHAPE is relevant due to its capability to probe all RNA nucleotides and the possibility to be used in vivo. However, the structural determinants for SHAPE reactivity and its mechanism of reaction are still unclear. Here molecular dynamics simulations and enhanced sampling techniques are used to predict the accessibility of nucleotide analogs and larger RNA structural motifs to SHAPE reagents. We show that local RNA reconformations are crucial in allowing reagents to reach the 2′-OH group of a particular nucleotide and that sugar pucker is a major structural factor influencing SHAPE reactivity.

We have employed two-to-one mapping scheme to develop three coarse-grained (CG) water models, namely, 1-, 2-, and 3-site CG models. Here, for the first time, particle swarm optimization (PSO) and gradient descent methods were coupled to optimize the force-field parameters of the CG models to reproduce the density, self-diffusion coefficient, and dielectric constant of real water at 300 K. The CG MD simulations of these new models conducted with various timesteps, for different system sizes, and at a range of different temperatures are able to predict the density, self-diffusion coefficient, dielectric constant, surface tension, heat of vaporization, hydration free energy, and isothermal compressibility of real water with excellent accuracy. The 1-site model is ~3 and ~4.5 times computationally more efficient than 2- and 3-site models, respectively. To utilize the speed of 1-site model and electrostatic interactions offered by 2- and 3-site models, CG MD simulations of 1:1 combination of 1- and 2-/3-site models were performed at 300 K. These mixture simulations could also predict the properties of real water with good accuracy. Two new CG models of benzene, consisting of beads with and without partial charges, were developed. All three water models showed good capacity to solvate these benzene models.",

Abstract: Computation of nonlinear optical response functions allows for an in-depth connection between theory and experiment. Experimentally recorded spectra provide a high density of information, but to objectively disentangle overlapping signals and to reach a detailed and reliable understanding of the system dynamics, measurements must be integrated with theoretical approaches. Here, we present a new, highly accurate and efficient trajectory-based semiclassical path integral method for computing higher order nonlinear optical response functions for non-Markovian open quantum systems. The approach is, in principle, applicable to general Hamiltonians and does not require any restrictions on the form of the intrasystem or system− bath couplings. This method is systematically improvable and is shown to be valid in parameter regimes where perturbation theory-based methods qualitatively breakdown. As a test of the methodology presented here, we study a system−bath model for a coupled dimer for which we compare against numerically exact results and standard approximate perturbation theory-based calculations. Additionally, we study a monomer with discrete vibronic states that serves as the starting point for future investigation of vibronic signatures in nonlinear electronic spectroscopy","Title: Imaging Channel Connectivity in Nafion Using Electrostatic Force Microscopy
Authors: Austin M. Barnes and Steven K. Buratto
Abstract:
Channel connectivity is an important material property that is considered in making higher-performance proton-exchange membranes. Our group has previously demonstrated that nearly 50% of the aqueous surface domains in Nafion films do not have a connected path to the opposite side of the membrane. These so-called “dead-end” channels lead to a loss in the conductance efficiency of the membrane. Understanding the structure of these dead-end channels is an important step in improving the conductance of the membrane. Although conductive atomic force microscopy is able to provide insight into the connected channels, it does directly report on the dead-end channels. To address this, we use electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) to probe channel connectivity in a Nafion thin film (100–300 nm) under ambient conditions. EFM provided an image of the capacitive phase shift, which is influenced by surface charge, dielectric permittivity, and tip-sample geometry. We studied several individual channels and measured the quadratic dependence of the EFM signal with the bias voltage. Applying a simple parallel plate model allowed us to assign differences in the EFM signal to particular channel shapes: connected cylindrical channels, dead-end cylinder channels, and bottleneck channels.

Kinetic step-growth polymerization is studied by dissipative particle dynamics coupled with our previously developed reaction algorithm on a coarse-grained level. The simulation result proves that this step-growth polymerization obeys the second-order reaction kinetics. We apply this algorithm to study the step-growth polymerization using the subunits with different flexibilities or within confinement. Good agreement of the number fraction distributions with the Flory distribution is obtained, implying that this algorithm is reasonable to describe such a kind of step-growth polymerization. This algorithm can further supply a convenient platform for simulating typical step-growth polymerization in reactive polymer systems.

Determination of protein–protein binding affinity values is key to understanding various underlying biological phenomena, such as how missense variations change protein–protein binding. Most existing non-rigorous (fast) and rigorous (slow) methods that rely on all-atom representation of the proteins force the user to choose between speed and accuracy. In an attempt to achieve balance between speed and accuracy, we have combined rigorous umbrella sampling molecular dynamics simulation with a coarse-grained protein model. We predicted the effect of missense variations on binding affinity by selecting three protein–protein systems and comparing results to empirical relative binding affinity values and to non-rigorous modeling approaches. We obtained significant improvement both in our ability to discern stabilizing from destabilizing missense variations and in the correlation between predicted and experimental values compared to non-rigorous approaches. Overall our results suggest that using a rigorous affinity calculation method with coarse-grained protein models could offer fast and reliable predictions of protein–protein binding free energies.

It has been suggested that the free ribose sugar hydroxyl of Ado76 of the tRNAThr (Ado762′OH) is the mechanistic base, promoting hydrolysis by orienting a nucleophilic water near the scissile Ser-tRNAThr ester bond. We have performed a computational study, involving molecular dynamics (MD) and hybrid ONIOM quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods, considering all possible editing mechanisms to gain an understanding of the role played by Ado762′OH group. More specifically, a range of concerted or stepwise mechanisms involving four-, six-, or eight-membered transition structures (total of seven mechanisms) were considered. In addition, these seven mechanisms were fully optimized using three different DFT functionals, namely, B3LYP, M06-2X, and M06-HF. The M06-HF functional gave the most feasible energy barriers followed by the M06-2X functional. The most favorable mechanism proceeds stepwise through two six-membered ring transition states in which the Ado762′OH group participates, overall, as a shuttle for the proton transfer from the nucleophilic H2O to the bridging oxygen (Ado763′O) of the substrate. More specifically, in the first step, which has a barrier of 25.9 kcal/mol, the Ado762′-OH group accepts a proton from the attacking nucleophilic water while concomitantly transferring its proton onto the substrates C–Ocarb center. Then, in the second step, which also proceeds with a barrier of 25.9 kcal/mol, the Ado762′-OH group transfers its proton on the adjacent Ado763′-oxygen, cleaving the scissile Ccarb–O3′Ado76 bond, while concomitantly accepting a proton from the previously formed C–OcarbH group.

We describe a strategy for experimentally-constraining computational simulations of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), using α-synuclein, an IDP with a central role in Parkinson’s disease pathology, as an example. Previously, data from single-molecule Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) experiments have been effectively utilized to generate experimentally constrained computational models of IDPs. However, the fluorophores required for single-molecule FRET experiments are not amenable to the study of short-range (<30 Å) interactions. Using ensemble FRET measurements allows one to acquire data from probes with multiple distance ranges, which can be used to constrain Monte Carlo simulations in PyRosetta. To appropriately employ ensemble FRET data as constraints, we optimized the shape and weight of constraining potentials to afford ensembles of structures that are consistent with experimental data. We also used this approach to examine the structure of α-synuclein in the presence of the compacting osmolyte trimethylamine-N-oxide. Despite significant compaction imparted by 2 M trimethylamine-N-oxide, the underlying ensemble of α-synuclein remains largely disordered and capable of aggregation, also in agreement with experimental data. These proof-of-concept experiments demonstrate that our modeling protocol enables one to efficiently generate experimentally constrained models of IDPs that incorporate atomic-scale detail, allowing one to study an IDP under a variety of conditions.
","Dynamic coarse-graining fills the gap between atomistic simulations and experimental investigations of mechanical unfolding

We present a dynamic coarse-graining technique that allows one to simulate the mechanical unfolding of biomolecules or molecular complexes on experimentally relevant time scales. It is based on Markov state models (MSMs), which we construct from molecular dynamics simulations using the pulling coordinate as an order parameter. We obtain a sequence of MSMs as a function of the discretized pulling coordinate, and the pulling process is modeled by switching among the MSMs according to the protocol applied to unfold the complex. This way we cover seven orders of magnitude in pulling speed. In the region of rapid pulling, we additionally perform steered molecular dynamics simulations and find excellent agreement between the results of the fully atomistic and the dynamically coarse-grained simulations. Our technique allows the determination of the rates of mechanical unfolding in a dynamical range from approximately 10−8/ns to 1/ns thus reaching experimentally accessible time regimes without abandoning atomistic resolution.

Abstract Rate processes are often modeled using Markov State Models (MSM). Suppose you know a prior MSM, and then learn that your prediction of some particular observable rate is wrong. What is the best way to correct the whole MSM? For example, molecular dynamics simulations of protein folding may sample many microstates, possibly giving correct pathways through them, while also giving the wrong overall folding rate, when compared to experiment. Here, we describe Caliber Corrected Markov Modeling (C2M2): an approach based on the principle of maximum entropy for updating a Markov model by imposing state- and trajectory-based constraints. We show that such corrections are equivalent to asserting position-dependent diffusion coefficients in continuous-time continuous-space Markov processes modeled by a Smoluchowski equation. We derive the functional form of the diffusion coefficient explicitly in terms of the trajectory-based constraints. We illustrate with examples of 2D particle diffusion and an overdamped harmonic oscillator.

Despite extensive scrutiny of the myosin superfamily, the lack of high-resolution structures of actin-bound states has prevented a complete description of its mechanochemical cycle and limited insight into how sequence and structural diversification of the motor domain gives rise to specialized functional properties. Here we present cryo-EM structures of the unique minus-end directed myosin VI motor domain in rigor (4.6 Å) and Mg-ADP (5.5 Å) states bound to F-actin. Comparison to the myosin IIC-F-actin rigor complex reveals an almost complete lack of conservation of residues at the actin-myosin interface despite preservation of the primary sequence regions composing it, suggesting an evolutionary path for motor specialization. Additionally, analysis of the transition from ADP to rigor provides a structural rationale for force sensitivity in this step of the mechanochemical cycle. Finally, we observe reciprocal rearrangements in actin and myosin accompanying the transition between these states, supporting a role for actin structural plasticity during force generation by myosin VI.

Most of the current understanding of structure–property relations at the molecular and the supramolecular scales can be formulated in terms of the stability of and the interactions between a limited number of recurring structural motifs (e.g., H-bonds, coordination polyhedra, and protein secondary structure). Here we demonstrate an algorithm to automatically recognize such patterns, based on the identification of local maxima in the probability distributions observed in atomistic computer simulations, which is robust to the dimensionality and the sparsity of the reference atomistic data. We first discuss its main features, demonstrating some on artificial data sets, and then show how it can be applied to identify coordination environments in Lennard-Jones clusters and to recognize secondary-structure patterns in the simulation of an oligopeptide. To assess the applicability of this algorithm for motifs that involve several interdependent degrees of freedom, we also employ it to identify groups of conformers of the cluster and the polypeptide, considered in their entirety. The motifs identified by analyzing atomistic simulations can be used to interpret and rationalize the stability and behavior of the system at hand, and also as a tool to accelerate sampling, in association with biased molecular dynamics schemes.",

In this work we introduce PHOENICS, a probabilistic global optimization algorithm combining ideas from Bayesian optimization with concepts from Bayesian kernel density estimation. We propose an inexpensive acquisition function balancing the explorative and exploitative behavior of the algorithm. This acquisition function enables intuitive sampling strategies for an efficient parallel search of global minima. The performance of PHOENICS is assessed via an exhaustive benchmark study on a set of 15 discrete, quasi-discrete and continuous multidimensional functions. Unlike optimization methods based on Gaussian processes (GP) and random forests (RF), we show that PHOENICS is less sensitive to the nature of the co-domain, and outperforms GP and RF optimizations. We illustrate the performance of PHOENICS on the Oregonator, a difficult case-study describing a complex chemical reaction network. We demonstrate that only PHOENICS was able to reproduce qualitatively and quantitatively the target dynamic behavior of this nonlinear reaction dynamics. We recommend PHOENICS for rapid optimization of scalar, possibly non-convex, black-box unknown objective functions.

The ML model is trained on (structure, total energy) relations collected during global minimum energy search runs with an evolutionary algorithm (EA).

Abstract
Markov state models (MSMs) have been widely used to analyze computer simulations of various biomolecular systems. They can capture conformational transitions much slower than an average or maximal length of a single molecular dynamics (MD) trajectory from the set of trajectories used to build the MSM. A rule of thumb claiming that the slowest implicit time scale captured by an MSM should be comparable by the order of magnitude to the aggregate duration of all MD trajectories used to build this MSM has been known in the field. However, this rule has never been formally proved. In this work, we present analytical results for the slowest time scale in several types of MSMs, supporting the above rule. We conclude that the slowest implicit time scale equals the product of the aggregate sampling and four factors that quantify: (1) how much statistics on the conformational transitions corresponding to the longest implicit time scale is available, (2) how good the sampling of the destination Markov state is, (3) the gain in statistics from using a sliding window for counting transitions between Markov states, and (4) a bias in the estimate of the implicit time scale arising from finite sampling of the conformational transitions. We demonstrate that in many practically important cases all these four factors are on the order of unity, and we analyze possible scenarios that could lead to their significant deviation from unity. Overall, we provide for the first time analytical results on the slowest time scales captured by MSMs. These results can guide further practical applications of MSMs to biomolecular dynamics and allow for higher computational efficiency of simulations.

Abstract
The importance of charge-charge interactions in the thermal stability of proteins is widely known. pH and ionic strength play a crucial role in these electrostatic interactions, as well as in the arrangement of ionizable residues in each protein-folding stage. In this study, two coarse-grained models were used to evaluate the effect of pH and salt concentration on the thermal stability of a protein G variant (1PGB-QDD), which was chosen due to the quantity of experimental data exploring these effects on its stability. One of these coarse-grained models, the TKSA, calculates the electrostatic free energy of the protein in the native state via the Tanford-Kirkwood approach for each residue. The other one, CpHMD-SBM, uses a Coulomb screening potential in addition to the structure-based model Cα. Both models simulate the system in constant pH. The comparison between the experimental stability analysis and the computational results obtained by these simple models showed a good agreement. Through the TKSA method, the role of each charged residue in the protein’s thermal stability was inferred. Using CpHMD-SBM, it was possible to evaluate salt and pH effects throughout the folding process. Finally, the computational pKa values were calculated by both methods and presented a good level of agreement with the experiments. This study provides, to our knowledge, new information and a comprehensive description of the electrostatic contribution to protein G stability.

Based on all-atom Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of a lipid bilayer we present a systematic mapping on a 2D lattice model. Keeping the lipid type and the chain order parameter as key variables we derive a free energy functional, containing the enthalpic interaction of adjacent lipids as well as the tail entropy. The functional form of both functions is explicitly determined for saturated and polyunsaturated lipids. By studying the lattice model via Monte Carlo simulations it is possible to reproduce the temperature dependence of the distribution of order parameters of the pure lipids, including the prediction of the gel transition. Furthermore, application to a mixture of saturated and polyunsaturated lipids yields the correct phase separation behavior at lower temperatures with a simulation time reduced by approximately 7 orders of magnitude as compared to the corresponding MD simulations. Even the time-dependence of the de-mixing is reproduced on a semi-quantitative level. Due to the generality of the approach we envisage a large number of further applications, ranging from modeling larger sets of lipids, sterols, and solvent proteins to predicting nucleation barriers for the melting of lipids. Particularly, from the properties of the 2D lattice model one can directly read off the enthalpy and entropy change of the 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine gel-to-liquid transition in excellent agreement with experimental and MD results.","Title: Simulations of the OKE Response in Simple Liquids Using a Polarizable and a Nonpolarizable Force Field
Authors: Kamil Polok
Abstract: Recently polarizable force fields are becoming increasingly popular for molecular dynamics simulations. As the signal obtained in the optical Kerr effect (OKE) experiment is due to the polarizability dynamics of the investigated system, a study is conducted in order to compare the experimental results with those obtained with the polarizable AMOEBA force field. The comparison is made in the frequency domain; however, time domain data are also included. The selected molecular systems are the isotropic carbon tetrachloride molecule, the anisotropic chloroform, carbon disulfide and acetone molecules, and the hydrogen-bonded water and methanol molecules. Different dipole-induced-dipole (DID) method variants are used for calculation of the OKE response, showing the importance of use of the all-atom approach with preoptimized atomic polarizabilities. In order to obtain a good intermolecular to intramolecular components amplitude ratio, the isotropic polarizability in the Thole correction needs to be updated between iterations. The convergence of the spectra calculated with different DID variants is also considered, and the approach that appears to be the best gives a very good approximation after three iterations. The comparison of the experimental and simulated spectra shows a rather good agreement for the non-hydrogen-bonded molecules, although the contribution of the reorientation of anisotropic molecules is overestimated. In the case of the hydrogen-bonded molecules, the theoretical spectra are far from the experimental ones. The highly overestimated librational bands indicate excessive polarizability anisotropy introduced by the potential model. Finally, in order to verify the significance of different components of the AMOEBA model, it is gradually simplified and compared with a simple reference potential model. Removal of polarizability shows a tremendous change in the case of hydrogen-bonded liquids, whereas for the other molecules it is of minor importance. The non-hydrogen-bonded liquids are, however, more sensitive to the presence of atomic multipoles in the model.

Abstract
Liquid-crystal polymers (LCPs) are well known materials for functional sensor and actuators, because of their high-responsiveness to an electric field. Owing to their complex physical nature, however, the prediction of the functions of LCPs is a challenge. To attack this problem from a molecular point of view, a simulation study is a promising approach. In this work, for future applications of molecular dynamics simulations to problems involving an electric field, we develop an LCP model which consists of coarse-grained mesogenic molecules and smeared charges. For the smearing function of the electrostatic force, the Gauss error function is introduced. This smearing is optimized to attain a reasonable accuracy for phase transition phenomena of liquid crystal while numerical instabilities arising from the singularity of the Coulomb potential are circumvented. For swelling systems, our LCP model exhibits the characteristics of both liquid crystals and unentangled polymer chains; orientational order of the mesogenic units and Rouse-like relaxation dynamics. Our coarse-grained LCP model successfully incorporates electric charges and dipoles and is therefore applicable to problems concerning an electric field.

The endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-III mediates membrane fission in fundamental cellular processes, including cytokinesis. ESCRT-III is thought to form persistent filaments that over time increase their curvature to constrict membranes. Unexpectedly, we found that ESCRT-III at the midbody of human cells rapidly turns over subunits with cytoplasmic pools while gradually forming larger assemblies. ESCRT-III turnover depended on the ATPase VPS4, which accumulated at the midbody simultaneously with ESCRT-III subunits, and was required for assembly of functional ESCRT-III structures. In vitro, the Vps2/Vps24 subunits of ESCRT-III formed side-by-side filaments with Snf7 and inhibited further polymerization, but the growth inhibition was alleviated by the addition of Vps4 and ATP. High-speed atomic force microscopy further revealed highly dynamic arrays of growing and shrinking ESCRT-III spirals in the presence of Vps4. Continuous ESCRT-III remodelling by subunit turnover might facilitate shape adaptions to variable membrane geometries, with broad implications for diverse cellular processes.","Title: Hydration Behavior along the Folding Pathways of Trpzip4, Trpzip5 and Trpzip6
Authors: Madhulika Gupta, Prabir Khatua, Charusita Chakravarty, and Sanjoy Bandyopadhyay
Abstract: The microscopic properties of water confined within different segments of Trpzip4 (TZ4), Trpzip5 (TZ5), and Trzpip6 (TZ6) have been compared for all the states characterized along their folding pathways. In particular, structural ordering, energetics, and dynamics of water have been examined as the peptide unfolds along the free energy landscape. It is observed that the structuring of tetrahedral network as well as translational and rotational motions of hydration waters confined within the strands and the turn regions are very different, revealing motional heterogeneity in small 16-residue trpzips. The polar and charged groups present at the peptide surface anchor to water molecules through hydrogen bonds and are responsible for differential hydration among various segments of the peptide, which is found to be correlated to their hydropathy values. The coherent collective dynamics of water is strongly coupled with conformational changes in the peptide since the trends observed in most of the computed quantities are in accordance with the folded and unfolded states classified along the folding pathway for all trpzips. The hydration behavior conform to the heterogeneity observed in the free energy landscape of stable TZ4 with four unfolded states as compared to more flexible TZ5 and TZ6 with two unfolded states each, in addition to the folded state. The hydration waters are observed to regulate the protein dynamics by continuous fluctuations in hydrogen bond network involving lateral side chains that inject conformational motions in the peptide to facilitate its unfolding. The implications of mutations on various aspects of hydration water dynamics including their impact on structural and dynamic organization of hydrogen bonds are also highlighted. Our studies affirm that topology of the free energy landscape is shaped by both spatial organization and dynamic transitions in hydration waters in addition to the conformational fluctuations in the peptide along the folding pathway.

,"Stochastic and superharmonic stochastic resonances of a confined overdamped harmonic oscillator
Lu Zhang, Li Lai, Hao Peng, Zhe Tu, and Suchuan Zhong
Phys. Rev. E 97, 012147 

The dynamics of many soft condensed matter and biological systems is affected by space limitations, which produce some peculiar effects on the systems' stochastic resonance (SR) behavior. In this study, we propose a model where SR can be observed: a confined overdamped harmonic oscillator that is subjected to a sinusoidal driving force and is under the influence of a multiplicative white noise. The output response of the system is a periodic signal with harmonic frequencies that are odd multiples of the driving frequency. We verify the amplitude resonances at the driving frequencies and superharmonic frequencies that are equal to three, five, and seven times the driving frequency, using a numerical method based on the stochastic Taylor expansion. The synergistic effect of the multiplicative white noise, constant boundaries, and periodic driving force that can induce a SR in the output amplitude at the driving and superharmonic frequencies is found. The SR phenomenon found in this paper is sensitive to the driving amplitude and frequency, inherent potential parameter, and boundary width, thus leading to various resonance conditions. Therefore, the mechanism found could be beneficial for the characterization of these confined systems and could constitute an important tool for controlling their basic properties.

Authors: Dimitrios Maganas, Serena DeBeer, and Frank NeeseIn this work, the efficiency of first-principles calculations of X-ray absorption spectra of large chemical systems is drastically improved. The approach is based on the previously developed restricted open-shell configuration interaction singles (ROCIS) method and its parametrized version, based on a density functional theory (DFT) ground-state determinant ROCIS/DFT. The combination of the ROCIS or DFT/ROCIS methods with the well-known machinery of the pair natural orbitals (PNOs) leads to the new PNO-ROCIS and PNO-ROCIS/DFT variants. The PNO-ROCIS method can deliver calculated metal K-, L-, and M-edge XAS spectra orders of magnitude faster than ROCIS while maintaining an accuracy with calculated spectral parameters better than 1% relative to the original ROCIS method (referred to as canonical ROCIS). The method is of a black box character, as it does not require any user adjustments, while it scales quadratically with the system size. It is shown that for large systems, the size of the virtual molecular orbital (MO) space is reduced by more than 90% with respect to the canonical ROCIS method. This allows one to compute the X-ray absorption spectra of a variety of large “real-life” chemical systems featuring hundreds of atoms using a first-principles wave-function-based approach. Examples chosen from the fields of bioinorganic and solid-state chemistry include the Co K-edge XAS spectrum of aquacobalamin [H2OCbl]+, the Fe L-edge XAS spectrum of deoxymyoglobin (DMb), the Ti L-edge XAS spectrum of rutile TiO2, and the Fe M-edge spectrum of α-Fe2O3 hematite. In the largest calculations presented here, molecules with more than 700 atoms and cluster models with more than 50 metal centers were employed. In all the studied cases, very good to excellent agreement with experiment is obtained. It will be shown that the PNO-ROCIS method provides an unprecedented performance of wave-function-based methods in the field of computational X-ray spectroscopy.

J.-T. Hsiang, C. H. Chou, Y. Subaşı, and B. L. Hu
Phys. Rev. E 97, 012135 

In a series of papers, we intend to take the perspective of open quantum systems and examine from their nonequilibrium dynamics the conditions when the physical quantities, their relations, and the laws of thermodynamics become well defined and viable for quantum many-body systems. We first describe how an open-system nonequilibrium dynamics (ONEq) approach is different from the closed combined system +  environment in a global thermal state (CGTs) setup. Only after the open system equilibrates will it be amenable to conventional thermodynamics descriptions, thus quantum thermodynamics (QTD) comes at the end rather than assumed in the beginning. The linkage between the two comes from the reduced density matrix of ONEq in that stage having the same form as that of the system in the CGTs. We see the open-system approach having the advantage of dealing with nonequilibrium processes as many experiments in the near future will call for. Because it spells out the conditions of QTD's existence, it can also aid us in addressing the basic issues in quantum thermodynamics from first principles in a systematic way. We then study one broad class of open quantum systems where the full nonequilibrium dynamics can be solved exactly, that of the quantum Brownian motion of N strongly coupled harmonic oscillators, interacting strongly with a scalar-field environment. In this paper, we focus on the internal energy, heat capacity, and the third law. We show for this class of physical models, amongst other findings, the extensive property of the internal energy, the positivity of the heat capacity, and the validity of the third law from the perspective of the behavior of the heat capacity toward zero temperature. These conclusions obtained from exact solutions and quantitative analysis clearly disprove claims of negative specific heat in such systems and dispel allegations that in such systems the validity of the third law of thermodynamics relies on quantum entanglement. They are conceptually and factually unrelated issues. Entropy and entanglement will be the main theme of our second paper on this subject matter.","Goethe, M.; Gleixner, J.; Fita, I.; Rubi, J.

Abstract:
We present a novel coarse-grain particle-based simulation technique for modeling self-developing flow of dilute and semi-dilute polymer solutions. The central idea in this paper is the two-way coupling between a mesoscopic polymer model and a phenomenological fluid model. As our polymer model, we choose Responsive Particle Dynamics (RaPiD), a Brownian dynamics method, which formulates the so-called “conservative” and “transient” pair-potentials through which the polymers interact besides experiencing random forces in accordance with the fluctuation dissipation theorem. In addition to these interactions, our polymer blobs are also influenced by the background solvent velocity field, which we calculate by solving the Navier-Stokes equation discretized on a moving grid of fluid blobs using the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) technique. While the polymers experience this frictional force opposing their motion relative to the background flow field, our fluid blobs also in turn are influenced by the motion of the polymers through an interaction term. This makes our technique a two-way coupling algorithm. We have constructed this interaction term in such a way that momentum is conserved locally, thereby preserving long range hydrodynamics. Furthermore, we have derived pairwise fluctuation terms for the velocities of the fluid blobs using the Fokker-Planck equation, which have been alternatively derived using the General Equation for the Non-Equilibrium Reversible-Irreversible Coupling (GENERIC) approach in Smoothed Dissipative Particle Dynamics (SDPD) literature. These velocity fluctuations for the fluid may be incorporated into the velocity updates for our fluid blobs to obtain a thermodynamically consistent distribution of velocities. In cases where these fluctuations are insignificant, however, these additional terms may well be dropped out as they are in a standard SPH simulation. We have applied our technique to study the rheology of two different concentrations of our model linear polymer solutions. The results show that the polymers and the fluid are coupled very well with each other, showing no lag between their velocities. Furthermore, our results show non-Newtonian shear thinning and the characteristic flattening of the Poiseuille flow profile typically observed for polymer solutions.",,

Abstract:Statistical learning methods show great promise in providing an accurate prediction of materials and molecular properties, while minimizing the need for computationally demanding electronic structure calculations. The accuracy and transferability of these models are increased significantly by encoding into the learning procedure the fundamental symmetries of rotational and permutational invariance of scalar properties. However, the prediction of tensorial properties requires that the model respects the appropriate geometric transformations, rather than invariance, when the reference frame is rotated. We introduce a formalism that extends existing schemes and makes it possible to perform machine learning of tensorial properties of arbitrary rank, and for general molecular geometries. To demonstrate it, we derive a tensor kernel adapted to rotational symmetry, which is the natural generalization of the smooth overlap of atomic positions kernel commonly used for the prediction of scalar properties at the atomic scale. The performance and generality of the approach is demonstrated by learning the instantaneous response to an external electric field of water oligomers of increasing complexity, from the isolated molecule to the condensed phase.",,

Abstract: 
A new semiclassical “divide-and-conquer” method is presented with the aim of demonstrating that quantum dynamics simulations of high dimensional molecular systems are doable. The method is first tested by calculating the quantum vibrational power spectra of water, methane, and benzene—three molecules of increasing dimensionality for which benchmark quantum results are available—and then applied to 
C60 , a system characterized by 174 vibrational degrees of freedom. Results show that the approach can accurately account for quantum anharmonicities, purely quantum features like overtones, and the removal of degeneracy when the molecular symmetry is broken.",,
